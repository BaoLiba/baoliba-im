The Brazilian TikTok influencer marketing industry is booming, with 1 in every 4 Brazilian TikTok users following influencers on the platform. 

There has already been a 200% increase in influencer product placements on TikTok in Brazil in 2023 compared to 2022.

With the Brazilian TikTok influencer marketing industry becoming a key player in the world of influencer marketing, brands can no longer overlook the opportunity it provides to reach the Brazilian market.

As a U.S.-based brand or marketing agency looking to work with Brazilian TikTok influencers, understanding how the Brazilian TikTok influencer marketing landscape differs from the U.S. is vital to getting the most out of your campaigns. 

Here‚Äôs what you need to know about working with Brazilian TikTok influencers.

# Brazil's TikTok Influencers Are Ahead of the Game

Brazil ranks as the third-highest country in the world for TikTok usage, with over 82 million active users.

Brazilian TikTokers have already mastered the platform‚Äôs best practices, as evidenced by the fact that they are more likely to use popular hashtags than their American counterparts. 

Brazilian TikTok influencers are also much more likely to use trending sounds than American TikTok influencers. 

American TikTok influencers use trending sounds 35% of the time, while Brazilian TikTok influencers do so 56% of the time, according to the 2023 TikTok Advertising Global Marketing Playbook.


# üìä Brazilian TikTok Influencers Are More Relatable

The most followed TikTok influencer in the U.S. is Charlie D‚ÄôAmelio, whose lifestyle content is aspirational and professional in tone.

In contrast, the Brazilian TikTok influencer most followed by Brazilians is T3ddy, a comedy and reaction content creator known for his relatable style and humor.

While U.S. TikTok influencers have followed a trajectory of heightened professionalism, Brazilian TikTok influencers have largely remained true to the platform‚Äôs grassroots origins and relatable style.

This difference in influencer style has implications for the way brands should approach TikTok influencer marketing in the two countries. 

While American brands have largely adopted the mentality of traditional advertising in their TikTok influencer campaigns, Brazilian brands have mostly embraced the platform‚Äôs creative roots and user-generated style.

# üí°How to Work With Brazilian TikTok Influencers

Adopting popular hashtag trends and trending sounds is a great way to help ensure your brand‚Äôs TikTok influencer campaigns will resonate with Brazilian audiences.

However, there are also significant logistical considerations involved in working with Brazilian TikTok influencers as a U.S.-based brand.

These considerations include platforms, payment options, and legal frameworks.

# üì¢ Use a TikTok Influencer Agency

The easiest way for a U.S.-based brand to work with Brazilian TikTok influencers is through an influencer marketing agency that specializes in the Brazilian market.

Influencer marketing companies have established processes and frameworks in place to make working with influencers in different countries as simple as possible.

U.S.-based brands looking to work with Brazilian TikTok influencers should reach out to influencer marketing agencies that have experience with Brazil and TikTok.

HypeAuditor is a leading influencer marketing agency that specializes in TikTok influencers and has expertise in the Brazilian market.

# üè¶ Payment Options

One of the logistical challenges U.S.-based brands face when working with Brazilian TikTok influencers is how they will pay them.

U.S.-based brands can utilize the services of an influencer marketing agency to handle payments on their behalf.

However, brands that choose to go it alone must be aware of the fact that Brazilian TikTok influencers expect to be paid in Brazilian real (BRL), the official currency of Brazil. 

PayPal is the most popular payment method among Brazilian TikTok influencers, followed closely by bank transfers.

Traditional credit and debit card payments are not commonly used by Brazilian TikTok influencers.

Additionally, brands also need to be aware of the fact that Brazil imposes higher fees on international money transfers than many other countries do.

For this reason, brands that wish to pay Brazilian TikTok influencers directly would be wise to work with a payment processor that specializes in cross-border payments, such as Wise.

# ‚ùó Legal Considerations

Brazilian TikTok influencers are subject to the same laws that govern influencer marketing in the United States.

That is to say, Brazilian TikTok influencers must clearly disclose any paid partnerships they have with brands.

Brazilian influencers are required to use the hashtags #ad and #publi to disclose sponsored content when it was paid for by brands.

Florida State University College of Law Professor of Law and Ethics Christine Hines explains that ‚ÄúBrazil has some of the strictest regulations on advertising in the world.‚Äù

According to Hines, ‚ÄúBrazil prohibits all forms of advertising directed at children and strictly regulates advertising of food and beverages directed at children, including through the Internet.‚Äù 

Additionally, Brazilian influencers must comply with the Brazilian Consumer Protection Code, which prohibits misleading advertising.

# üåé Conclusion

Brazil's TikTok influencer marketing industry has already surpassed that of the U.S. in many ways, including the number of influencers and the amount of paid partnerships.

With U.S.-based brands eager to capitalize on this exciting opportunity, they must also be aware of the various logistical details involved in working with Brazilian TikTok influencers.

Brands that utilize influencer marketing agencies that specialize in Brazil and TikTok will have the smoothest experience collaborating with Brazilian TikTok influencers.

By leveraging Brazil's TikTok influencer marketing industry, U.S.-based brands can successfully tap into Brazil's growing social commerce market, projected to reach $31 billion by 2025.
