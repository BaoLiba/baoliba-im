Since 2021, WhatsApp influencer marketing has been booming in Romania. This underground growth is expected to be fully mainstream by the end of 2025.

WhatsApp accounts for 67% of total social media time spent in Romania. Romanian influencers must engage followers on WhatsApp instead of Instagram, which has seen a decrease in engagement across Europe.


## üìä Romania's Instagram Decline
In 2022, a survey of the Romanian influencers showed that only 13% of their total interactions came from Instagram. 

88% of Romanian influencers who utilized Instagram in 2021 said their total interactions have declined since then. 
This is in line with broader trends across Europe and North America, where Instagram has seen a steady drop in user engagement since 2020.


## üí° What Influencing on WhatsApp Looks Like
There are three categories of WhatsApp influencers in Romania:

1. **Brand Account Managers:** Individuals or small agencies that represent brands and personalize their communications on WhatsApp.

2. **Individual Influencers:** Influencers with a significant following on other social media platforms who routinely post on WhatsApp status.

3. **WhatsAppers:** These Romanian influencers have built their audience entirely on WhatsApp. They typically promote themselves on platforms with a more casual atmosphere, like TikTok. 

Most WhatsApp influencers in Romania share their WhatsApp number with followers. 

Your brand‚Äôs WhatsApp account manager, for example, will likely share screenshots of their chats with others. 

They often ask followers to DM them directly on WhatsApp. 

Those who primarily operate on WhatsApp will usually share their link using WhatsApp‚Äôs in-app sharing functionality on other platforms.

WhatsApp influencers in Romania can share a unique link that allows others to open a chat with just one click.

According to a recent poll of Romanians who are aware of WhatsApp influencers, 89% said they received unsolicited offers for goods or services from WhatsApp influencers and 65% responded.

Over 70% of respondents said they purchased a good or service from a Romanian WhatsApp influencer who contacted them.

WhatsApp influencer marketing is a major issue in Romania. 

More than half of adult Romanians have been contacted by an influencer on WhatsApp.



## ‚ùó What's Next for Instagram Influencers in Romania?
For US brands, working with Romanian influencers is a double-edged sword. 

On one hand, hiring Romanian influencers can lead to higher conversions and lower campaign costs. 

On the other hand, brands will be left out of the loop if they don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on behind the scenes.

Romanian influencers regularly use WhatsApp to promote brands, products, and services. 

As influencers continue to lose engagement on Instagram, expect their WhatsApp promotions to increase.

### WhatsApp Influencing Growth Expectation

High competition for influencer marketing budgets will soon lead to higher prices. 

Only brands that are aware of this ongoing situation will be able to take advantage of the lower pricing being offered now. 

Romanians have trusted WhatsApp influencers to promote products and services for many years.

Almost 90% of Romanians based their transaction on the influencer‚Äôs relationship with them, not their prior knowledge of the brand.

### Pricing for WhatsApp Influencers in Romania
Romanian WhatsApp influencers charge 0.004 to 0.022 cents per person reached on their WhatsApp Status. 

This is significantly lower than most paid advertising. 

Online advertising has a median cost of $3.80 per person reached.

### Example of Influencer Pricing

For example, if a Romanian WhatsApp influencer‚Äôs Status is viewed by 300 people, they could expect to earn between $12 and $66.

Also, this price may only cover one post on their Status. 

Simply put, it may not be enough for a brand to engage that influencer. 

Price increases are expected by 2025 as more brands realize how much they will miss out if they don‚Äôt work with Romanian WhatsApp influencers.

### Table of Influencer Pricing for Various Services

| Service Rendered          | Pricing (USD)     |
|---------------------------|-------------------|
| Image of Product          | $12 - $66         |
| Image of Product + Link   | $12 - $66         |
| Voice Note                | $6 - $36          |
| Text Message              | $6 - $36          |
| Video                      | $12 - $66         |
| Video + Link              | $12 - $66         |


## üì¢ WhatsApp Influencer Marketing Not as Free as it Seems
WhatsApp influencers in Romania have two problems when it comes to payments.

1. **Group Chats:** In the past, Romanians have exploited group chats to run fake influencer schemes. 

More recently, mass advertising on WhatsApp has become popular among scammers. 

Official WhatsApp Business accounts can be set up for free. 

This has led to fraudsters using them to scam Romanians.

A group chat containing 256 participants was once the biggest problem for WhatsApp influencers. However, that limit was raised to 1,024 in 2022.

Romanian influencers who do promotions in bulk must work within these constraints. 

They also run the risk of being kicked out of their chat if someone reports it.

From time to time, WhatsApp will ban all users in the group, including the group creator. 

Also, if a group chat goes dark, all of the work put into it is lost. 

WhatsApp allows for backup of chats, usually over Google Drive. 

However, a person only has one chance to backup their chat history or they run the risk of losing it forever.

2. **Payment Processors:** The second payment constraint comes from payment apps. 

Romania has a strong reputation for fighting against corruption. So, Romanians are big fans of using cashless payment apps. 

Most of them also prefer working with apps that charge no fees on payments, like cash apps.

A recent study in Romania showed that no cash payment methods are favored by 88% of Romanians. 

This is in line with many EU member states. Sweden was the first EU country to eliminate cash from circulation by 2030.

### Popular Payment Apps among Romanians
Money transfers have been a hot topic across Europe. Last year, the European Commission announced plans to reduce the fees associated with cross-border money transfers to 7 euro cents.

This is good news for Romanian WhatsApp influencers who promote US brands. 

Because of the strong possibility of payment apps suffering from higher transaction fees, it is best to work with popular ones. 

This is because there is a stronger chance that US brands can find a workaround to pay for promotional services.

Check out the image below for the most popular cashless payment apps among Romanians.

### Transaction Fees of Popular Cash App Alternatives
| App Name             | Transaction Fee (%)   |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| Wise                 | 0.55%                |
| Revolut              | Free up to ‚Ç¨1,000, then 0.5% |
| N26                  | 1.7%                 |
| Payoneer             | 1%                   |
| Venmo                | Free (1-3 days) 1.5% (Instant) |
| Stripe               | 1.4% + ‚Ç¨0.25         |
| Cash App             | Free                 |
| Western Union        | 5%                   |

Both US and Romanian brands should beware of scams when dealing with influencers. 

Employer identification numbers (EIN) are important when it comes to paying taxes in the US. 

This is why it is a good idea to ask for a Romanian influencer's tax identification number (TIN) and proof of identity before hiring them.

Not only will it give brands peace of mind, it will also help them comply with their home country tax laws.


## üìà How to Identify Scams
For US brands looking to work with influencers in Romania, here are some things to look out for when assessing whether an influencer is likely to scam you.

1. **Free Work:** A legitimate influencer will rarely work for free. They are in business to make money like everyone else. If someone wants you to pay upfront or wants to work for free, they are likely a scammer.

2. **No Previous Work:** Instagram and TikTok profiles of influencers usually have some proof of their past work. If a profile has no posts or recent uploads, they are likely to scam you.

3. **Too Good to Be True:** If an influencer offers a significantly lower price than their competition, they may not be who they say they are.

4. **Chat Only on One Platform:** If an influencer insists that you only chat with them on one platform, they likely want to take you for a ride. 

A legitimate influencer will probably want to chat with you on a platform of your choice. They may even use more than one platform to accommodate their clients.

5. **Too Many Followers:** Scammers commonly use bots to inflate their follower count. If an influencer has a suspicious follower count, they could be trying to deceive you. You can use fake follower checkers to see whether or not they are using bots.

6. **Payment Information:** Scammers will usually ask you to pay using a method that protects them, like gift cards. Legitimate influencers will usually have a business payment method and will not ask you to pay a deposit before starting.

Many Romanian influencers are taking advantage of the growing demand for their professional services. 

They are doing it the right way, too.
