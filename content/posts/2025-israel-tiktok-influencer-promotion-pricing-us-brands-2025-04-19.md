It's crucial to understand the pricing structure associated with TikTok influencer promotions in Israel for your 2025 marketing strategy. In this article, we will highlight everything you need to know about the pricing of TikTok influencers in Israel for American brands looking to market their products and services in the region.

Understanding TikTok's importance in the Israeli marketplace is essential for American brands that want to capitalize on this trend and use TikTok influencers to connect with a valuable demographic.

There are also a number of factors that will affect how much an Israeli influencer will charge. Here are the factors that will influence pricing and what American brands can expect to pay to get Israeli TikTok influencers to promote their products or services:

### üìà Pricing Based on Follower Count

### üíé Pricing Based on Engagement Rate

The engagement rates of TikTok influencers in Israel are also taken into account when determining how much they will charge. According to a report published in the most recent 2023 Israel Influencer Marketing Report, the average engagement rate for influencers on TikTok in Israel is 5.25%, which is relatively high. However, micro-influencers have reported engagement rates of 11.63%. 

This means that micro-influencers can command higher prices than macro-influencers who have lower engagement rates. The same report mentions that, in general, influencers with over 10% engagement rates can charge about **‚Ç™200 (approximately $53)** more than those that have lower engagement rates. 

### üìä Pricing Based on Video Length

- 15-second videos: **‚Ç™2,500 (approximately $665)**
- 30-second videos: **‚Ç™3,500 (approximately $930)**

### ‚ùó Additional Factors Affecting Pricing

There are a number of additional factors that can influence how much TikTok influencers in Israel charge for promotional posts. 

#### üí≤ Exclusivity Clauses

Many brands will want to ensure that their competitors are not being promoted by the same influencers they are using. In such cases, brands may negotiate for exclusivity clauses.  Brands may pay anywhere from **‚Ç™5,000 (approximately $1,330)** to **‚Ç™15,000 (approximately $3,990)** for exclusivity, depending on the influencer's popularity.

#### ‚è≥ Usage Rights

If a brand wants to get more value out of its influencer marketing efforts, it may want to negotiate usage rights to the promotional content. This means that the brand has the rights to use the influencer's content in their own marketing efforts. Depending on the influencer‚Äôs popularity, usage rights can cost an additional **‚Ç™200 (approximately $53)** to **‚Ç™7,500 (approximately $2,000)** or more.

#### üôå Influencer Management Agency Fees

If American brands are looking to work with multiple Israeli TikTok influencers for their marketing efforts in 2025, they may want to work with an influencer marketing agency. However, brands should keep in mind that agencies charge fees that can account for anywhere from **10% to 30%** of the total cost of working with an influencer.

#### üìú Contract Length

If American brands are looking to work with an Israeli TikTok influencer for an extended period (e.g., multiple posts), they may be able to negotiate for a lower price per post. For example, a brand that commits to working with an influencer for four posts (instead of just one) may negotiate a price of **‚Ç™2,400 (approximately $636)** for each post instead of **‚Ç™2,500 (approximately $665)**.

#### üöö Shipping Products

When it comes to influencers promoting products, they often require that products be sent to them for them to create the promotional content. Brands should factor the cost of shipping products into their budget.

When it comes to working with Israeli TikTok influencers, there are a number of strategies American brands can employ, including:

One of the most effective ways to ensure that brands are getting the best deals possible when it comes to using TikTok influencers in Israel is to work with a reputable influencer marketing agency. These agencies have well-established connections with influencers and can usually negotiate better rates than brands can find on their own.

#### üì≤ Reaching Out to Influencers Directly

Many influencers in Israel have personal websites or social media profiles that brands can use to contact them directly. Brands can send them a message outlining their services and request a media kit so they can see what the influencer has to offer and how much they charge.

In many cases, influencers have a solid understanding of their worth and will be upfront in discussing their fees and expectations.

#### üìà Working with a TikTok Influencer Marketplace

TikTok influencer marketplaces can allow brands to make connections with influencers in a streamlined way. These marketplaces allow brands to search for influencers that are a good fit based on a variety of metrics, including audience demographics, engagement rates, and average pricing. 

Once brands find influencers they want to work with, they can often make direct inquiries to see if the influencer is interested in collaborating. Some marketplaces also have built-in communication capabilities that can allow brands and influencers to iron out a deal without leaving the platform.
