When US brands think of influencer marketing, they often think of the United States or even the European market. However, New Zealand is an exciting place to scout for up-and-coming influencers that can help your brand reach a different audience with the same message.

According to Statista, New Zealand consumers spend an average of $7,900 NZD ($4,817.85 USD) online each year, so they are already showing willingness to invest in brands and products outside their region.

But just like with influencer marketing in the United States, it can be difficult to determine what prices New Zealand influencers charge for promotions. After all, every influencer is different and can charge different rates for their services.

This article aims to provide a general idea of the pricing structures that New Zealand influencers are using to promote US brands.


### üí° What Influencer Marketing Looks Like in New Zealand 

Just like in the United States, influencer marketing in New Zealand involves brands reaching out to popular social media figures to promote their products and services. Influencers can often have millions of followers, but they can also be more niche with far fewer followers.

New Zealand influencers can reach out to United States audiences through platforms like Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and YouTube, which allows brands to promote their products to consumers in the United States using influencers from New Zealand.

### üìä Influencer Marketing Pricing Structure in New Zealand 

The pricing for influencer marketing in New Zealand can change depending on a few factors, including the influencer's reach and engagement rates, the nature of the content created, and the type of promotion requested by the brand.

In general, influencers in New Zealand can charge anywhere from $5 NZD ($3.10 USD) for a social media post to $1,000 NZD ($621.71 USD) for a video on TikTok. Other types of promotions include Instagram Stories, Instagram posts, and Instagram Reels, which can range from $140 NZD ($86.94 USD) to $500 NZD ($310.86 USD), depending on the influencer.

### üí∞ Average Cost of Influencer Marketing in New Zealand 

The average cost of influencer marketing in New Zealand falls within a relatively similar range as other markets. According to a survey conducted by NZ marketing agency The Digital Voice, New Zealand influencers can charge the following prices for their services:

- **Instagram Post**: $140 NZD ($86.94 USD)
- **Instagram Story**: $200 NZD ($124.68 USD)
- **Instagram Reel**: $300 NZD ($186.98 USD)
- **Facebook Post**: $200 NZD ($124.68 USD)
- **Facebook Story**: $300 NZD ($186.98 USD)

- **TikTok Post**: $1,000 NZD ($621.71 USD)
- **Blog Post**: $1,000 NZD ($621.71 USD)

As you can see, the pricing structures for New Zealand influencers is quite similar to that of United States influencers. 

### ‚ùó What Influencers Look For When Pricing 

While influencer pricing can vary from influencer to influencer, there are some common factors that influencers tend to look at when determining their rates. Here are some of them:

1. **Audience Size**: Often, the larger the audience, the more expensive the promotion. This is because influencers with larger audiences can reach a greater number of potential consumers. 
   
2. **Engagement Rate**: Some influencers may have a smaller audience but a much higher engagement rate, which can make their promotions more valuable. 
   
3. **Content Quality**: Influencers who produce high-quality content (e.g. stunning photos, well-made videos, etc.) may charge more for their services. 

4. **Niche**: Influencers in certain niches may be more valuable to brands in similar niches, which can affect pricing. For example, a fitness influencer may charge more for promoting a fitness product than a lifestyle influencer would. 

5. **Promotion Type**: Different types of promotions can have different prices. For example, an Instagram post may cost more than just an Instagram Story.

6. **Experience**: Influencers with more experience may charge more for their services, while newer influencers may be more affordable. 

While these are just a few of the common factors that can influence the pricing of influencer promotions, it's important to remember that every influencer is different and can charge different rates for their services.

3. **Unprofessional Behavior**: Some influencers may not conduct themselves in a professional manner, which can reflect poorly on your brand. Be sure to vet influencers thoroughly before working with them. 

4. **False Claims**: Some influencers may make false claims about your product or service, which can damage your brand's reputation. Be sure to set clear expectations with influencers about what they can and cannot say in their promotions.

5. **Lack of Results**: Not all influencer promotions will result in sales or leads for your brand. Be sure to set realistic expectations and measure results to see if influencer marketing is right for you.
