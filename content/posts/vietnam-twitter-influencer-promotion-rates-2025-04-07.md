Vietnam is the most Twitter-addicted country in Southeast Asia. In addition to serving millions of monthly active users, Twitter is also popular among marketers in the country because of its unique editorial tone and the built-in virality of its content.

Social media marketing with Twitter influencers can be very lucrative for brands. If you're interested in collaborating with Vietnamese influencers on the platform, you'll want to know just how much they charge.

## üáªüá≥ Twitter Influencer Marketing Scene in Vietnam

In Vietnam, Twitter is the preferred social media platform for celebrities, political figures, and influencers because of its real-time format and popular virality. 

While a mainstream social media platform like Facebook favors softer and more curated content, Twitter is unfiltered and raw. This difference makes influencer marketing on the platform more edgy and unpredictable.

Vietnamese Twitter influencers depend on this tendency to address trending topics, share memes, and provoke reactions. Here are just a few of the popular accounts across various niches:

- **@DuyNguyen0405** is a comedy account that has gained a significant following for his humorous takes on a variety of topics.
- **@kinhdoanhmen** is a controversial account that specializes in marketing tips despite being banned from other major platforms.
- **@zabarao** is a political commentator that covers news and current events.

Due to its unique nature, the cost of Twitter influencer marketing in Vietnam is different from that of other platforms.

## üí∞ Prices of Vietnamese Twitter Influencers

More than half of Vietnamese influencers on Twitter charge less than 20 USD per promotional post. This is a stark contrast to Vietnamese influencers on Instagram and TikTok, where the majority charge over 100 USD.

Check out this table for a breakdown of pricing based on the number of followers an influencer has: 

| Followers | Price Range |
| --------- | ----------- |
| 0 - 1,000 | $0 - $20 |
| 1,000 - 5,000 | $40 - $80 |
| 5,000 - 10,000 | $80 - $150 |
| 10,000 - 50,000 | $150 - $500 |
| 50,000+ | $500+ |

Aside from the number of followers, other factors can also affect pricing. This includes content type and the niche of the account.

Pricing for tweets can begin at just 5 USD, with accounts of at least 10,000 followers charging between 500 and 800 USD. Video or image ads start at 50 USD, while polls usually cost around 40 USD.

Accountants in niches like finance or law can command much higher prices due to their expertise. They can charge from 80 to 200 USD per promotional tweet.

## üì¶ Payment Methods

Most Vietnamese Twitter influencers receive payments via bank transfer. This is fairly standard across the industry.

However, brands may have to deal with additional fees or longer processing times, as banks often have to review transactions for anti-money laundering purposes.

Other methods of receiving payments include PayPal, Braintree, and Stripe. These are acceptable to most influencers, but they usually involve transaction fees of 2 to 5 percent.

Brands can also pay in cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency in Vietnam. Though the country has moved toward banning some transactions, Bitcoin is still widely accepted by a number of influencers.

## üíµ Sponsored and Shoutout Tweets

The majority of promotional tweets in Vietnam are shoutouts or mentions. This is because they are more aligned with the platform's editorial style and often more relatable.

Shoutout tweets simply mention the brand without any call to action. These are usually the cheapest promotions.

A promotional tweet, on the other hand, is often a full advertorial that may include links and media. Brands should be advised that these types of promotions can be seen as inauthentic and may perform poorly. 

## üîè Contracts or Agreements

In Vietnam, contracts for influencer marketing are usually oral agreements. This is common among many Southeast Asian countries where business is often conducted based on trust.

However, it would be prudent to have a written contract for influencer marketing in Vietnam. These contracts can clarify services, payments, and other conditions, thereby protecting the brand from possible misinformation or other risks.

Ultimately, influencer marketing collaborations with Vietnamese Twitter influencers can be very affordable and effective. Brands can get significant exposure with minimal investment.
