If you're considering leveraging the burgeoning popularity of South Korean Twitch influencers for advertising, you're in for a rude awakening!  

It's no secret that Korean influencers command some of the highest rates worldwide. Understandably, they offer unparalleled access to high-value audiences you can‚Äôt easily reach through traditional advertising.  

In this article, we'll delve into how much you might expect to pay for a Twitch marketing collaboration with a Korean influencer.


## üí∞ Average Pricing for Twitch Collaboration with Korean Influencers

A recent survey indicates that the average cost for collaboration with mid-tier Korean Twitch influencers stands at approximately 1.3 million KRW per hour of streaming.  

According to the recent report on influencer pricing in Korea, fees can soar as high as 5 million KRW ($3,700) and above for top-tier influencers.  

On the lower end, niche Korean Twitch influencers may accept promotional offers for anywhere from 300,000 KRW ($224) per hour.  

Below are estimated pricing ranges for various tiers of Korean Twitch influencers:  

|Influencer tier|Price range (per hour of streaming)|  
|---|---|  
|Top-tier (1 million Twitch followers or more)|1.5 - 5 million KRW ($1,200 - $3,700)|  
|Mid-tier (100,000 - 1 million followers)|600,000 - 1 million KRW ($450 - $750)|  
|Niche/Low-tier (10,000 - 100,000 followers)|300,000 - 600,000 KRW ($224 - $450)|  


## üìä Pricing Influencers vs. Advertising Agencies

As is the case with other marketing channels, you can secure better pricing by going directly through influencers instead of through agencies.  

According to Korea‚Äôs largest influencer marketing agency, the average price for collaborating with a Korean Twitch influencer through advertising agencies may add anywhere from 25% to 50% to the above pricing averages.

|Influencer tier|Price range (per hour of streaming)|  
|---|---|  
|Top-tier (1 million Twitch followers or more)|3 - 7 million KRW ($2,400 - $5,200)|  
|Mid-tier (100,000 - 1 million followers)|800,000 - 1.5 million KRW ($600 - $1,100)|  
|Niche/Low-tier (10,000 - 100,000 followers)|500,000 - 800,000 KRW ($400 - $600)|  


## üì¢ Payment Methods

Korean Twitch influencers generally accept wire transfers, but more and more are adopting Stripe, PayPal, and other payment services as part of their collaboration process to accommodate global brands.  

Wire transfers may incur additional fees or delays, and using established payment platforms would help streamline transactions.  

If you‚Äôre using wire transfer, providing a Korean bank account might save you a bit of money and time over using a Western bank account.  

Generally speaking, it‚Äôs best to offer Korean Twitch influencers payment options they‚Äôre most comfortable with.  


## ‚ùó Legal Considerations

Unlike many other countries, the South Korean government closely monitors advertising by influencers for compliance with various laws.  

Failure to adhere to advertising regulations can lead to hefty fines.   

As of 2023, fines for not adhering to the advertising code of conduct can range from 20 million KRW ($15,700) to 500 million KRW ($392,000) in the most serious instances.  

To mitigate financial risks, make sure that every aspect of your collaboration aligns with Korea's advertising regulations.


## üì¢ Conclusion

As you can see, the cost of hiring Korean Twitch influencers isn't for the faint of heart.   

However, if your market research indicates that Korean Twitch influencers can help achieve your advertising goals, you should take the leap.
