## üí∞ How Payment Occurs with UK Influencers

After discussing pricing, it‚Äôs important to know how payments are made when collaborating with UK influencers.

Most influencers have a profile on platforms that facilitate influencer-brand partnerships, such as BaoLiba.

When you hire an influencer through BaoLiba, payments are made upfront through the platform‚Äôs secure payment system.

These established platforms properly vet influencers and ensure they fulfill their obligations to brands.

For example, if you hire a UK influencer with 300K followers to create a video review of your app on Facebook for $1,000 through BaoLiba, the influencer receives the payment only after submitting the content and the brand confirms its quality and acceptance.

## üíµ Currency Conversion Fees from USD to GBP

When hiring a UK influencer using USD, it's also important to consider currency conversion fees.

Currency conversion fees can vary significantly depending on how your payment is processed.

For example, if you‚Äôre using PayPal, they often charge a 3% conversion fee. This means that to pay a UK influencer $1,000, you would first have to convert your USD to GBP using PayPal‚Äôs exchange rate, which would cost $30 in conversion fees.

This is why it‚Äôs advisable to use a payment processor that offers competitive conversion rates and lower fees when hiring UK influencers.
