Chinese Instagram or Youtube influencer marketing is an effective way to reach and engage with potential customers in key target markets.

Tencent Content Open Platform (TCOP) is a social media influencer program focused on Chinese consumers. It opened up the enormous Tencent ecosystem for the talented influencers that produce the kind of content the Tencent ecosystem thrives on. 

The TCOP offers brands the ability to collaborate with influencers across China's largest social media platforms like WeChat, Tencent Video, QQ, and Weibo, which account for over 1.2 billion daily active users. 

The TCOP boasts over 1.5 million media influencers and over 100 million content creators, making it one of the largest influencer marketing platforms available.

As the USA brands are entering China, the TCOP is offering the influencer marketing programs in partnership with BaoLiba, the leading global influencer marketing platform.

This article will give USA brands the influencer marketing pricing for Tencent's Content Open Platform.

## üìä Pricing for TCOP Influencer Marketing in the USA

At a high level, the pricing for influencer marketing on Tencent's Content Open Platform offers packages that can start as low as $500 and go as high as $200,000 or more depending on the influencer's reach and engagement.

The pricing depends on various factors that can be broken down into the following categories:

1. **Influencer Scale & Type**: As expected, larger influencers demand higher fees, and those who engage their audiences will charge even more. Influencers will range from small influencers with just a few thousand followers to those with millions of followers.
2. **Social Media Platform**: Different social media platforms have different pricing models based on their monetization methods. From the TCOP pricing we can see that WeChat articles charge more than Weibo posts.
3. **Content Type**: Influencers create content through various mediums including text, video, and images. The more complex the content, the more expensive it will be.
4. **Collaboration Scope**: Influencer marketing can range from a single post to a comprehensive multi-channel campaign with multiple influencers. 

## üì¢ Cost of TCOP Influencer Marketing Campaigns

The pricing model for Tencent Content Open Platform influencer marketing is very similar to Western social networks. 

This allows USA brands to easily translate their existing social media influencer marketing strategies into the TCOP. 

The pricing lists three different types of influencer marketing campaigns that come with different pricing structures.

1. **Single-Channel Campaigns**: These campaigns focus on a single type of influencer collaboration in a single social media platform. For example, a WeChat article influencer campaign would only feature a single article with no additional influencer marketing support. 
2. **Multi-Channel Campaigns**: These campaigns combine multiple types of influencer collaborations across multiple social media platforms. An example could be a combination of WeChat articles and Weibo posts that are part of the same marketing program. 
3. **Performance-Based Campaigns**: Performance-based influencer marketing campaigns charge based on how well the influencer performs their collaboration. For example, if a WeChat influencer article drives traffic to an e-commerce website, the influencer may receive a commission for the sales made through their article.

## üì¢ What is the Tencent Content Open Platform?

The Tencent Content Open Platform (TCOP) encourages creators to produce quality content for the Tencent ecosystem. 

The TCOP opened up the enormous Tencent ecosystem for individuals and brands in a systematic content creation program. 

The TCOP places the spotlight on top social media creators to offer brands the best influencer marketing programs available. 

TCOP influencers generate content that can be distributed across all major Tencent platforms including:

1. **WeChat**: The largest social media platform in the world with over 600 million daily active users.
2. **QQ**: The second largest social media platform in the world with over 400 million daily active users.
3. **Tencent Video**: The second largest video streaming platform in the world with over 120 million daily active users. 
4. **Weibo**: The largest microblog in China and the fourth largest social media platform in the world with over 250 million daily active users. 

By opening up the Tencent ecosystem to influencers and brands, TCOP has become the number one resource for brands that need to reach Chinese consumers.

## üìä Why Use a Tencent Content Open Platform Influencer?

The primary reason why USA brands should consider using Tencent Content Open Platform influencers is the sheer size of the platforms. 

With over 1.2 billion daily active users on their platforms, Tencent offers a huge audience that is actively engaged across multiple channels.

While it is important to realize that there are differences in how social media functions in China, the basic influencer marketing model is still valid. 

USA brands can leverage the popularity of TCOP influencers to reach Chinese consumers and expand their brands in the region. 

### üì¢ What is Different about Marketing to China?

It is critical for brands that they understand that marketing in China is entirely different than marketing in the USA. 

Not only does China have its own unique social media platforms, but they also have their own unique marketing methods.

For USA brands that want to effectively enter the Chinese market, it is essential to use Chinese influencers and content creators to reach and engage Chinese consumers.

USA brands cannot rely on their existing influencer marketing strategies to be successful in China. Building a brand in China requires an entirely different approach.

## üìä What is Different about Marketing in China?

A few key differences between the USA and China that affect how brands market are:

1. **Social Media Platforms**: In China, Western social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram are banned, along with Google, Twitter, and YouTube. As a result, Chinese brands rely on their own established social media platforms like Tencent and Weibo to reach their consumers. 
2. **Social Media Influencers**: Since Western social media influencers cannot tap into the Chinese social media platforms, Chinese social media influencers have emerged and grown tremendously popular. They operate under the same influencer marketing model that has made social media influencers so popular in the first place but have uniquely evolved into their own specific ecosystem. 
3. **Unique Marketing Methodology**: The marketing methodology that is successful for USA brands doesn‚Äôt translate well to the Chinese market. For example, advertising in the USA often promotes the features and benefits of a product, focusing on how it will improve the customer's life. However, the Chinese consumer is more interested in how a product reflects their social status. As a result, marketing in China must focus on the image the product can provide the consumer.

## üì¢ Conclusion

As Chinese brands continue to enter the USA and other Western markets, USA brands should also enter China to further expand their reach. 

The TCOP is the leader in helping brands reach Chinese consumers and has the influencers to make it happen. 

Influencer marketing on TCOP is the simplest and fastest way for USA brands to reach one of the largest audiences on the planet.
