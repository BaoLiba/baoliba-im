## üì£ Why should brands consider Aussie LinkedIn influencers? 

Leveraging influencers with a significant following to promote services and products is a mainstream trend used by many brands. Studies show that brands earn $6.50 per every dollar spent on influencer marketing. 

A significant aspect of influencer marketing on LinkedIn is that nearly half of B2B consumers rely on peer-to-peer recommendations before considering a purchase. This is a major reason why brands targeting Australian consumers should consider using LinkedIn influencers in their marketing strategies! 

### üë• Where do Aussie users fit in?

Australia has a relatively low number of LinkedIn users compared to other countries, such as the United States, and is only ranked 15th globally. In fact, Australia accounts for only 3.7% of the total Asia Pacific user base! 

Yet despite this disparity, LinkedIn is the fastest-growing social media platform in Australia, boasting a whopping 22% growth rate over the past 3 years. This impressive growth range has resulted in at least 10 million Australian users funneling into the platform!

Over the past 10 years alone, LinkedIn has seen a 50% increase in users aged 25 to 34. This surge in the number of younger users has shifted the demographic of LinkedIn users from typically older and more senior professionals to a diverse range of mid-level professionals. 

### üìÖ What about trends in 2024?

According to 2024's statistics, 2025 will see a growing number of LinkedIn users share posts and create videos, while more conventional marketing techniques such as email marketing are losing traction!

- **2.5 million posts** were shared in December 2024 alone!
- **1.25 million videos** were also created and shared across the platform in the same month!

This trend mirrors the flexibility found in all popular social media platforms and indicates that LinkedIn is becoming less rigid in its use while also appealing to a wider audience.
