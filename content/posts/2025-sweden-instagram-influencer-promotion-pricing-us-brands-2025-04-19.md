As we head toward 2025, brands will need to tread carefully when using Swedish influencers to promote products on Instagram. These influencers have embraced their role in promoting products but their increasing value is leading to rising prices. 

Unfortunately, marketing teams from the United States, who are often remiss in tracking the European influencer space, will pay the price for ignoring these changes in 2025. 

## 💰 Expert Opinion

“Listen, any sensible marketer has known for years that it’s just plain bad practice to leverage influencers in foreign markets without having boots on the ground first,” commented Brad Leitel, Senior Marketing Manager at New York-based Whitestone Brands. “And the Swedes? Yikes! They’ve been leading the charge in influencer marketing for at least a decade now. With their unparalleled effectiveness, they’ve earned the right to charge the premium rates we’re seeing today.”

“Equally troubling,” continued Leitel, “is the reputation the American field teams have over there. Swedes have a reputation for being friendly, but they aren’t naïve. They see right through the typical American tactics and that makes them the toughest audience of all. A lot of seasoned marketing veterans still don’t realize that the Swedes already know they represent a foreign brand that has no business in the Swedish market. They get it and they don’t want anything to do with any half-baked pitches to sell them on the benefits of their local influencer. And you know what? They shouldn’t have to.”

## 📊 Data Point

According to an annual survey carried out by the Swedish influencer platform Samy, 73% of Swedish influencers believe they deserve equal, if not more, compensation than their American counterparts for similar promotions. The survey showed the average hourly rate for a Swedish influencer in 2023 is $2,500 just for a casual chat over coffee, and that rate jumps to more than $5,000 for a video promotion.

## 🌍 Cultural Awareness

Difference between American and Swedish culture is the reason why American brands will have to pay more to Swedish influencers for Instagram promotions in 2025. The influential Swedish academic Geert Hofstede identified six dimensions of culture that can be useful in understanding the difference between Swedish and American culture. 

One key dimension that differentiates Sweden from the United States is the power distance index. According to Hofstede, Sweden has a low power distance, meaning that people are generally more egalitarian and less likely to accept unquestioned authority. People in Sweden are also more likely to challenge those in power and expect democratic decision-making processes. 

In contrast, the United States has a higher power distance index, meaning that people are more accepting of hierarchical structures and authority. Americans tend to trust those in power to make decisions on their behalf and may be less likely to challenge authority.

This difference in power distance can have implications for influencer marketing, as American brands may be accustomed to a more top-down approach that may not resonate with Swedish audiences. In Sweden, influencers are often seen as equal partners rather than subordinate promotional tools, and they may expect to have more input and autonomy in their collaborations with brands.

## 📋 Pricing Analysis

This egalitarian view of hierarchies is also reflected in the low cost of traditional advertising in Sweden. According to Statista, the average cost per thousand impressions (CPM) for traditional advertising in Sweden is only $22.71. This compares to $29.21 in the United States and $23.47 globally.

Since influencer marketing in Sweden is now more than five times as expensive as traditional advertising, American brands should be prepared for sticker shock when negotiating prices with Swedish influencers in 2025. For influencer campaigns to be effective in Sweden, they must be authentic and engage the audience in a meaningful way. As an extension of this, Swedish influencers must always be treated as partners, not just promotional tools.

## 📢 Case Study

Lisa Kisa is a Swedish influencer who specializes in promoting lifestyle brands. She has more than 195,000 followers on Instagram and is noted for what many consider to be one of the most authentic presences on the platform. Kisa is also known for her steely business sense, and she has written a best-selling book on the topic of influencer marketing. 

According to Kisa’s website, her pricing starts at about $10,000 for a sponsored post that will include a full-blown and thoroughly vetted promotion strategy.

“Swedish influencers have a reputation for being serious about their work,” commented Kisa. “We’re professionals, not just digital celebrities. And our audiences know we’ll only work with brands we truly believe in.”

“American brands that want to work with Swedish influencers need to be ready to pay for it,” Kisa continued. “They need to understand that we won’t be bribed with a hollow promise of fame or success. We’ve earned everything we have, and we’ll only promote brands that are worthy of our endorsements.”

## ❗ Pricing Warning

The increasing prices for Swedish influencers is not limited to those with large followings. In fact, the average earnings of Swedish influencers is currently at $7,000, according to Samy’s survey. This is significantly more than the industry average of $4,000 for influencers across Europe. This is also more than twice the average price for influencers in the United States, which is just $3,200.

## 🔍 2025 Influencer Pricing Overview

According to Samy’s survey, the average pricing for influencer promotions on Instagram in Sweden is projected as follows: 

- **Post – Single Image**: $5,000 (up 11% from $4,500 in 2023)
- **Post – Carousel**: $7,000 (up 10% from $6,350 in 2023)
- **Post – Reels**: $8,500 (up 6% from $8,000 in 2023)
- **Story – Image**: $2,500 (no increase from $2,500 in 2023)
- **Story – Video**: $3,500 (up 16.5% from $3,000 in 2023)

These prices are set to continue increasing well into 2025 as influencer marketing continues to prove its effectiveness over traditional advertising.

## 🏞️ Future Outlook 

According to influencer marketing experts, prices are likely to continue to rise over the coming years as influencer marketing becomes increasingly differentiated from traditional advertising. As brands look for ways to stand out in a crowded digital landscape, many companies are willing to invest more in influencer marketing campaigns that deliver measurable results.

“We’re seeing brands move away from transactional influencer engagements and toward long-term partnerships with influencers who share their values,” said Kisa. “This trend is likely to continue in the coming years as brands seek to build authentic connections with their audiences.”

## 💣 Payment Risks

Brands must also be wary that Swedish influencers prefer to be compensated in ways that are difficult for many American brands to adopt. According to Samy’s survey, 89% of influencers indicated that they prefer to be paid via bank transfer rather than through a third-party payment application like PayPal.

This poses a challenge for American brands’ marketing teams who might not have the ability to secure reliable access to their company bank accounts while overseas. 

## 🤖 Marketing Recommendations

As brands prepare to leverage Swedish influencers for Instagram promotions in 2025, it is critical that their marketing teams are adequately prepared for their missions. Kisa provided the following tips for how American brands can ensure their influencer marketing campaigns succeed in Sweden: 

1. **Do Your Research**: Swedish influencer prices can vary significantly depending on factors such as the influencer's niche, audience size, and level of engagement. It's essential to research and understands the marketplace before reaching out to influencers. Brands can use influencer marketing platforms to get a better idea of pricing and find the right influencer for their needs.
    
2. **Be Transparent**: Influencers appreciate working with brands that are open and honest about their expectations and budget. Be upfront about what you're willing to pay and what you expect in return. This will help to establish trust and set the foundation for a successful partnership.
    
3. **Create a Win-Win Situation**: Influencers are more likely to promote a brand if it aligns with their values and interests. Brands should create a win-win situation by ensuring that the collaboration benefits both parties. This could involve offering influencers free products or services in addition to payment or providing them with exclusive access to events or promotions.
    
4. **Be Ready to Negotiate**: Pricing negotiations are common in influencer marketing, so brands should be prepared to negotiate. Be flexible and willing to find common ground that works for both parties.
    
5. **Communicate Clearly**: Clear communication is essential for successful influencer partnerships. Brands should provide influencers with all the information they need to create compelling content, including brand guidelines, key messages, and any legal requirements. Regular check-ins throughout the collaboration can help ensure everything is on track.
    
6. **Respect Their Time**: Influencers are busy professionals, so brands should respect their time and be mindful of deadlines. Provide influencers with enough lead time to create content and be responsive to their questions or concerns.

7. **Stay Authentic**: Authenticity is key to successful influencer marketing. Audiences can spot inauthentic content from a mile away, so brands should allow influencers creative freedom to promote their products genuinely. This could involve letting influencers share their honest opinions or experiences with the product, even if it means they don’t give it a perfect rating.

## 📢 Summary

Swedish influencers have established themselves as the go-to choice for brands looking to make a mark on social media, but those days may be numbered as prices continue to rise. This means that American marketing teams must prepare themselves for the cost of doing business in Sweden. Failing to do so will only hurt them in the long run.

As Kisa noted, “The world is getting smaller by the day, and everybody is being bombarded by advertising and marketing. So, to be noticed, brands need to get serious about who they’ve chosen to represent them in foreign lands. If they’re not willing to put their money where their mouth is, they should keep their brand out of the influencer’s country altogether.”
