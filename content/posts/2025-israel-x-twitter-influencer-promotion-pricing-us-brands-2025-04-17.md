## ðŸ“Š Influencer Pricing Trends in Israel

A significant 62% of Israeli influencers now prefer to use X instead of Instagram for promotional campaigns.

The increase in popularity of X among Israeli influencers is driven largely by the unique advantages the platform offers when it comes to ad placements and promotional pricing.

Unlike Instagram and other platforms, X charges influencers based on the number of impressions their promotional posts generate instead of a flat rate.

Over the last several years, X has introduced several features including a new system for ad placements which allows influencers to sell sponsored posts on an impression basis. 

The X platform has also introduced additional new features that allow influencers to earn fees based on the number of impressions their accounts generate.

Unlike Instagram influencers who can only charge brands a flat rate of $150 to $300 for each promotional post, influencers on X can earn up to five times more than their counterparts on Instagram from their promotional posts.

This is a major reason behind the considerable increase in the number of Israeli influencers migrating from Instagram to X.

However, for average and large influencers, pricing on X remains relatively stable with rates ranging from $300 to $1,000 per post. 

Large influencers on X typically have more than 50,000 followers and can charge brands up to $10,000 for a single promotional post.

When compared to Instagram influencers, X influencers in the same follower range can cost between 40% and 60% less than Instagram influencers.
