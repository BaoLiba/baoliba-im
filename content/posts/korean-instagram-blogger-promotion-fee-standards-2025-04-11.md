While the above figures serve as a comprehensive guide, it‚Äôs essential to consider other factors that can influence the pricing.

## üë©‚Äçüè´ Pricing Influencers Beyond Followers

While follower count is the most significant contributing factor to how much Korean influencers charge for Instagram promotions, a few other elements can also influence their pricing.

1. **Engagement Rate**

The average engagement rates on Instagram are around **3%** for influencers with a follower count between **10,000 and 100,000** and **1.5%** for influencers with **100,000 to 1 million** followers. 

Korean influencers that boast engagement rates higher than average may charge more for their promotions.

2. **KPI Objectives**

Beat the average pricing guide above by understanding how much influencers charge based on different KPI objectives:

| KPI Type     | **Post Price (in USD)**  | **Story Price (in USD)**   |
|:--------------------------:|:-----------------------------:|:-------------------------------:|
| Brand Awareness           | $210 - $500                  | $100 - $200                     |
| Lead Generation            | $500 - $800                  | $200 - $350                     |
| Promotion of Offer          | $800 - $1,200              | $350 - $600                     |
| Content Production         | $1,200 - $2,500              | $600 - $1,200                  |

3. **Niche**

The influencer‚Äôs niche can also determine the rate they command. For instance, Korean fashion influencers may charge differently compared to beauty stars.

4. **Package Deals**

Some influencers provide package deals that include multiple posts, reels, stories, and features on their other social media platforms. 

5. **Influencer Marketing Agency Involvement**

If influencers work with an influencer marketing agency, they may demand a higher rate to cover agency commission fees. 

6. **The Influence Channel Used**

Influencers may earn more for using different channels. For example, a video post typically costs more than a photo post. Similarly, a reel costs more than a story.

7. **Type of Brand Collaboration**

Some types of collaborations require more effort and creativity than others. Therefore, influencers may charge extra for:

- Live collaborative sessions
- Giveaways
- Tutorials and Demos
- Takeovers
- Events

8. **Production Value**

How much effort and investment in time and resources that influencers commit to creating content can also play a part in their pricing.

For example, if an influencer uses sophisticated equipment or skillfully edits a video, they may charge more to compensate for their production time.

9. **Compatibility**

If influencers can relate to your brand values and appreciate your products, they may charge less for their promotions to enable a successful partnership. 


## üí° How to Find and Collaborate With Korean Influencers on Instagram?

Finding suitable Korean influencers to collaborate with is a matter of shortlisting candidates, vetting them, and negotiating to reach an agreement.

Start searching for influencers by browsing through Instagram itself.

- Use the **explore** page to find accounts with a high engagement rate.
- Look at posts that use relevant hashtags.
- Note down influencers that may best suit your brand.

Use influencer marketing platforms to find potential candidates quickly and bypass the hassle of going through lists manually.

- **Fake Follower Check** - Use tools like **HypeAuditor** or **Social Blade** to reveal how many followers are not authentic.
- **Content Review** - Assess the influencer‚Äôs content for quality and relevance. Check for the comments section to gauge how the influencer‚Äôs audience reacts to their content.
