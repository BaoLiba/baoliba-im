## üí∞TikTok Influencer Pricing in New Zealand

According to industry insights, NZ TikTok influencers charge an average of US $616 per post in 2025.

Let‚Äôs break down the average pricing of New Zealand TikTok influencers by follower counts.

| 1K-10K | $238 |
| 10K-50K | $417 |
| 50K-100K | $557 |

## üíµ Payment Methods for New Zealand TikTok Influencers

When partneri‚Äãng with TikTok influencers in New Zealand, US brands can utilize their credit card, PayPal, Wise, or bank wire transfer for payment. 

Using your credit card is one of the most straightforward payment methods. However, a standard credit card might incur unfavorable currency exchange rates and foreign transaction fees. 

Using PayPal is another easy and safe payment option because it allows you to send payments online without having to share your bank account number or credit card details with the influencer. However, PayPal can also charge higher fees and may not be the best option for larger payments. 

Using Wise is another viable option. Wise offers convenient money transfers with lower fees and real exchange rates. 

Via Wise, you can send money to a New Zealand bank account for a fee of 1.17% under standard service and 1.86% under express service. 

A bank wire transfer is another option, but it can be the least convenient, as it involves a trip to your bank branch, and transfers can take up to five days to clear. Additionally, banks often charge hefty service fees for wire transfers and a poor exchange rate.
