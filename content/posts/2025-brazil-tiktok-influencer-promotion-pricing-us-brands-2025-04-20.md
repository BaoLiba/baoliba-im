With 4.1 million influencers, Brazil dominates the TikTok scene, leading the world in content creators per capita.

In 2025, American brands can expect to pay competitive prices for influencer marketing, comparable to the U.S. market.

### üí≤ TikTok Influencer Pricing Overview

In 2023, it was reported that TikTok influencers charge anywhere from $500 to $25,000 for promotional posts, depending on follower count.

In Brazil, the rates are similar, typically ranging from BRL 2,500 to BRL 37,500. 

With the current exchange rate of BRL 4.72 to the dollar, that converts to about $530 to $7,955.

From local boutiques to global brands, American marketers who seek TikTok influencer promotion in Brazil can expect competitive pricing in 2025. 

### üìà Influencer Marketing Growth

With such a saturated market for TikTok influencers, American brands can expect a steady influx of rising stars, while established figures gain even more traction.

According to Molly O‚ÄôBrien, a marketing professor at Purdue University, Brazil has roughly **four times more influencers** than the United States.

In 2022, 27% of Brazilian influencers reported earning money from their social media accounts, compared to just 20% of their U.S. counterparts.

Therefore, American brands can expect many new talents in the mix, as they chase the financial opportunities of influencer marketing.

### üìä User Engagement Figures
In addition to having more influencers, Brazil is also home to **more TikTok users overall.** 

According to Statista, Brazil has the largest TikTok audience in the world, with **over 100 million users**.* 

The U.S. TikTok user base is only about half that size at **70 million.**

Moreover, the latest influencer marketing survey from HypeAuditor, a leading analytics platform, reported that **Brazilian influencers enjoy better audience engagement** than American influencers.

This is especially true of nano influencers, who have fewer than 1,000 followers.

While U.S. nano influencers achieve only a 6.77% engagement rate, Brazilian nano influencers achieve an impressive **11.09%.**

Marketers considering TikTok influencer promotion in Brazil can be assured that there will be no shortage of ways to connect with potential customers.

### üîç Social Media Perception

According to a 2023 survey of Brazilian consumers, **48%** of respondents indicated that they used TikTok to search for information on products and services.

That's **10% higher** than American users.

In recent years, TikTok has evolved into one of the primary search engines for younger consumers. Therefore, having a presence on TikTok can enhance brand awareness and credibility.

According to influencer marketing agency Olapic, TikTok‚Äôs algorithm favors creators who use TikTok‚Äôs native tools, such as editing features and music. Therefore, **Brazilian influencers** are **the best choice** for marketers looking to maximize their impact.

This trend is especially true for brands that target younger consumers, as **46%** of TikTok users are under the age of 30. 

### üìÖ Viral Trends
In Brazil, the latest fashion trends are *influenced* by TikTok challenges, where social media users comment on videos while embedding their own. 

For example, the Brazilian *taco skirt* style trend began with a TikTok challenge started by a 20-year-old influencer. 

In the challenge, users show how to recreate the trendy skirt by following a short tutorial.

TikTok fashion trends have been shown to significantly influence user shopping habits. 

According to a survey by Media Kix, **44%** of users reported shopping directly on TikTok.

Additionally, **50%** of TikTok users indicated that they are likely to purchase a product after seeing it on the platform.

Furthermore, **21%** of users indicated that they spend an hour or more shopping on TikTok each week.

American brands can leverage these trends by partnering with Brazilian TikTok influencers.

### ü§† Market Examples
American brands can find success in Brazil by approaching influencer marketing with a local mindset.

For example, in 2022, 7-Eleven partnered with Brazilian TikTok influencer Luisa Marilac to promote its new plant-based menu.

In a TikTok duet challenge, 7-Eleven took the iconic outro song from Luisa‚Äôs *Da Duna* TikTok series and used it in a commercial featuring Luisa.

Luisa is one of the leading LGBTQ+ influencers in Brazil, with over **15 million followers** on TikTok and more than **6 million** followers on Instagram.

According to HypeAuditor, **91%** of Luisa‚Äôs followers are real users, with only **9%** located outside of Brazil.

### üì¢ Top Influencer Agencies
Brazillian influencer marketing agencies can help American brands navigate cultural nuances and maximize their ROI.

For example, **BA Influencer Agency** specializes in connecting American brands with Brazilian TikTok influencers. BA charges a flat **15% commission** for their services.

Another example is **Crossover**, which connects brands with micro and nano influencers across multiple platforms, including TikTok. They charge between **BRL 1,000 and BRL 2,000** for campaigns. 

### ü§ù Payment Solutions
When it comes to paying for Brazilian influencer marketing services, American brands can rely on established cross-border payment platforms. 

For example, **PayPal** is widely used across Brazil, while **Wise** has over **25 million customers** in Brazil, making it a popular choice for paying influencers.

### üìÉ Ad Regulations
There is one significant difference when marketing with influencers in Brazil that American brands will need to consider.

Unlike in the United States, Brazilian law requires influencers to **disclose paid promotions.**

In Brazil, influencers must use the hashtag **#publi** in promotional posts, which stands for ‚Äúpublicidade,‚Äù meaning ‚Äúadvertisement‚Äù in Portuguese.

Furthermore, TikTok has its own set of promotional guidelines that influencers must adhere to. 

### üö¶ Conclusion
Despite having the world‚Äôs largest TikTok audience, Brazilian TikTok influencer marketing is still an untapped resource for many American brands.

However, with influencer rates comparable to the U.S. market, American brands should take advantage of this massive opportunity while prices are still low.

Brazilian TikTok influencers are more than just pretty faces. They have the skills to help American brands create authentic content that resonates with their audience and drives sales.
