As brands in the United States set their sights on Spain for influencer campaigns in 2025, it's essential to understand the local pricing landscape on Instagram.

Spanish influencers, like their American counterparts, typically have varying rates based on follower count, engagement rate, and content type.

However, US brands must recognize that Spain is not America, and therefore, prices, payment methods, and campaign practices will differ significantly from home.


## üìä Spanish Influencer Pricing vs. US Influencer Pricing

While influencer pricing in Spain has some similarities to pricing in the US, there are three major differences brands must keep in mind.

### üí∞ Spanish Influencer Pricing is Lower  

Compared to US influencers, Spanish influencers charge much lower rates for Instagram promotions. 

For example, US influencers with over 100,000 followers typically charge $1,500 per post. Spanish influencers of the same size usually charge only $600, or a bit less.

### üí∏ Spanish Influencers Prefer Hourly Pricing  

In Spain, influencer pricing for Instagram promotions is often billed on an hourly basis, as opposed to a flat fee per post, as used by many American influencers. 

For example, Spanish influencers might charge around ‚Ç¨200 ($220) per hour for Instagram promotions.  

### üìÖ Spanish Influencers Require More Time  

Lastly, promotional campaigns involving Spanish influencers will typically take longer to complete than campaigns with American influencers.

While an American influencer may only need 24 hours to post, a Spanish influencer may require several days or even weeks. 

According to marketing agency The Influencer Marketing Factory, 63% of Spanish influencers take their time when posting sponsored content. 

Be aware that this slower pace can extend the timeline of your entire campaign.


## üì¢ Spanish Influencers Vary by Niche

As in the US, Spanish influencers charge different prices depending on their niche.

**Fashion influencers** are the most popular influencer type in Spain, followed by celebrities, beauty influencers, and travel influencers.

According to a recent survey conducted by the Spanish influencer marketing agency F5, **fashion influencers** with over 100,000 followers charge an average of **‚Ç¨1,097** ($1,208) per post, while travel influencers of the same size charge only **‚Ç¨432** ($472) per post. 


### üåé Top Ten Types of Influencers in Spain  

1. Fashion
2. Celebrity
3. Beauty
4. Travel
5. Fitness
6. Gaming
7. Technology
8. Food
9. Finance
10. Sports  


## ‚ùóHow to Pay Influencers in Spain--and Why It Matters

While payment methods for influencers in Spain have many similarities to payment methods in the US, there are a few key differences as well. 

### üí≥ PayPal is Not as Popular

For American brands, PayPal is the most popular payment method among influencers. 

In Spain, however, brands should be prepared to pay through bank transfer, as Spanish influencers prefer to be paid this way.

According to F5, 93% of influencers in Spain prefer a bank transfer for payments. Only 9% prefer PayPal, and just 1% prefer Checks.

### üí∏Cash is Still King  

While cash may not be a viable payment option for most American brands, it still holds a prominent place in the Spanish influencer payment landscape. 

According to F5, 43% of influencers in Spain still accept cash for payments.

### ‚è±Ô∏è Payment Delays are Common  

Lastly, American brands hiring Spanish influencers should expect payment delays to be more common than in the United States.

According to F5, 36% of Spanish influencers take more than 14 days to pay their invoices, while 12% take more than 30 days. 

### ‚è≥ Payment Timeline  
- **1-3 days:** 28%
- **4-7 days:** 15%
- **8-14 days:** 21%
- **14-30 days:** 36%
- **30+ days:** 12%
- **Never pay:** 1%  


## üì¢ Spanish Influencer Contracts are More Relaxed

When it comes to contracts, American influencers tend to be more strict than Spanish influencers. 

According to F5, 73% of influencers in Spain do not sign contracts, unlike in the US where most influencers do.

Furthermore, when Spanish influencers do use contracts, they tend to be more general and less strict than contracts in the US. 


### üìú Contracts in Spain  
- **No contract:** 73%
- **General:** 21%
- **Strict:** 6%  


## üßæ Best Practices for Influencer Marketing in Spain  

When launching an influencer marketing campaign in Spain, US brands should follow these best practices to ensure a successful and productive campaign.


### üì£ Use Spanish Influencer Platforms  

While there are many popular influencer marketing platforms in the US, such as BaoLiba and Upfluence, brands in Spain should use platforms that cater specifically to Spain. 

Spanish influencer marketing platforms such as **Influencity**, **Kolsquare**, and **Geniuz** are all great options. 


### üì± Go Local  

While many of America‚Äôs hottest brands may use influencers to promote their products and services on Instagram, this strategy does not always translate to success in Spain and other countries. 

In Spain, brands should not waste resources asking American influencers to promote their products. Instead, brands should look for Spanish influencers with similar qualities. 

### üìçHow to Find Spanish Influencers  

While platforms like **BaoLiba** can help brands find influencers around the world, there are also many ways for brands to find Spanish influencers for themselves. 

1. **Hashtags**: Brands can search popular hashtags in their niche, along with the word "Spain" or "Espana" to find influencers who are posting about their products or services.

2. **Competitors**: Brands can check out what Spanish influencers have worked with their competitors for inspiration.  

3. **Google**: Brands can even search **"Spanish influencers"** or **"Top influencers in Spain"** to find lists of influencers in Spain.


## üì¢ Spanish Influencers are More Accessible  

While influencer pricing in Spain may be lower than in America, this does not mean Spanish influencers are any less valuable. 

In fact, a recent study found that 83% of influencers in Spain are open to working with brands, while in the US, only 46% are. 

What this means for American brands is that while they may find Spanish influencers to be just as valuable as American influencers, they are far more accessible. 

Brands should take advantage of the accessibility of Spanish influencers as they prepare for their 2025 marketing campaigns.
