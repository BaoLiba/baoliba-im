In 2025, Irish influencers and Irish-American influencers will continue using the X platform, previously known as Twitter, as a staple of their promotional strategies. 

They will charge a premium for their services due to the high-performance metrics of X, combined with how far it allows brands to stretch their promotional reach.

In terms of influencer pricing, American brands that want to target audiences in Ireland or Irish-Americans living in the states will need to pay the higher rates that accompany such premium placements.

## ‚ùó Key Takeaway 

The average price of promoting a brand on X by Irish influencers is currently $2,311, which is expected to fall below $2,000 in 2025.

Nevertheless, X promotions are worth every penny, as they bring in the highest ROI of any marketing strategy in Ireland. 

Brands looking to maximize their impact on X should partner with Irish influencers who consistently post content, and Irish influencers with audiences that include Irish-Americans who engage with every post like it‚Äôs a piece of gold.
