In the US, Facebook is often seen as a bit old-fashioned for influencer marketing. Young people, after all, have abandoned it in droves in favor of TikTok and Snapchat. 

But in Canada, this is not the case.

If you plan on marketing your product or service to our neighbor to the north, you may want to add Facebook influencer promotions to your plans, especially if you‚Äôre targeting younger people.

Facebook is still a juggernaut up there, and Canadian influencers are much more likely to have significant followings there than their American counterparts. 

So, what can you expect to pay?

Let‚Äôs take a look.

## üìä Price Ranges for Canadian Facebook Influencer Promotions

Expect to pay between $250 and $4,500 for a Facebook post from a Canadian influencer as of 2025.

While large influencers charge tens of thousands per post, the vast majority do not. Only the very largest celebrity influencers like Ryan Reynolds can demand those prices.


|Influencer Type|Price Range|Average Price|
|---|---|---|
|Nano (1K - 10K)|$250 - $1,000|$500|
|Micro (10K - 50K)|$500 - $1,500|$1,000|
|Mid-tier (50K - 200K)|$1,000 - $2,500|$1,500|
|Macro (200K - 1M)|$2,500 - $4,500|$3,500|
|Mega (1M+)|$5,000+|$6,000+|


These prices are generally quoted in Canadian dollars, meaning they will be even lower for American brands since the conversion rate favors the greenback.

However, be wary of any influencer offering a set price, especially if it‚Äôs too low. 

A price on the lower end might indicate an influencer who‚Äôs just starting out and has little reach. 

But since reach is what you want, this is usually a no-win proposition. 

### üìí Price Considerations 

When searching for influencers to promote your brand, there are a few things to keep in mind that will influence the price:


1. **The type of promotion you want.** A simple shout-out will generally cost less than a post featuring the influencer actually using your product or service. 

2. **The type of content you want.** A video that highlights your brand will usually be more expensive than just a photo with a caption.

3. **The length of the campaign.** The longer a campaign runs, the more expensive it will usually be. Multi-post promotions will be priced lower for the aggregate of all posts than if you were to pay the full asking price for each post separately. 

4. **Shared promotions.** An influencer giving you a shout-out in a group promotion with other brands will usually be lower priced than a single-brand promotion. 

5. **Contingencies.** It‚Äôs always smart to negotiate contingencies in your agreement, such as a money-back guarantee or the ability to change the type of post. 

6. **Ads.** If you want to boost a post to increase its reach, that will cost more.

7. **Platforms.** If you want the influencer to promote your brand on other platforms besides Facebook, that will usually cost more as well.


## üí∞ Payment Methods

Many Canadian influencers will accept Canadian dollar payments via PayPal, Venmo, wire transfer, or other methods. 

However, American influencers might want payment in US dollars to avoid conversion fees. 

Be sure to ask about their preferred payment method before entering into an agreement.


## üìû How to Find a Canadian Facebook Influencer

The best way to find and partner with a Canadian Facebook influencer is to use an influencer marketing platform. 

Although there are some free databases available, they‚Äôre usually not very accurate, especially where follower counts are concerned. 

A more reliable option is to go with a paid service like BaoLiba that specializes in influencer marketing. 

These services usually have proprietary software that scans social media looking for qualified influencers and compiles them into searchable databases. 

They can usually be filtered by location, audience, and follower count, making it easy to find a suitable Canadian Facebook influencer.

Once you find some influencers that fit your requirements, these services handle negotiations and contracts on your behalf. 

This is important, as influencer marketing has its own unique legal requirements that can be tricky for the inexperienced. 

Platforms like BaoLiba are well-versed in these requirements and will ensure that everything is handled properly.

### üìå Why Hire an Influencer Marketing Agency Instead of Doing It Yourself? 

While influencer marketing platforms do all the heavy lifting, influencer marketing agencies take the work off your hands completely. 

These services will not only find influencers for you but also create and configure your marketing campaign. 

They‚Äôll even manage it and report back with analytics on how it performed.

This may cost more than doing everything yourself, but it will free you to focus on other things, like creating and fulfilling orders. 

Agencies like BaoLiba will help you avoid the pitfalls of influencer marketing, such as working with influencers who have fake followers, and ensure that your campaign is a success.


## üìà The Benefits of Partnering with a Canadian Facebook Influencer 

There are many reasons to partner with a Canadian Facebook influencer. 

In addition to the familiarity they have with their audience, there are other benefits as well.

### 1. **Shared Language**

While Canadians do have their own peculiar accent and some unique slang, they primarily speak English. As a result, American brands can create campaigns that resonate with their audience without having to localize their messaging in any significant way. 


### 2. **Similar Culture** 

Though there are some differences, Canada and the US share a lot of cultural similarities. This has a positive effect on how well marketing messages are received, as they don‚Äôt have to be translated for differences in culture.  


### 3. **Niche Markets** 

Canada is home to some niche markets that aren‚Äôt present in the US, such as people who speak French. This allows brands to reach these audiences by using influencers who have credibility with them.  


### 4. **Facebook Usage** 

As mentioned earlier, Facebook is still a prominent social media platform in Canada. As a result, influencers have a much larger potential reach than in the US, especially among Gen Z. 


### 5. **Lower Cost** 

Advertising costs in Canada are generally lower than they are in the US, which is good news for brands. Influencer promotions are no exception. 


### 6. **Strong Conversion** 

Canadian influencers usually have great engagement rates and can deliver audiences that are primed to convert, leading to a higher return on investment.  


### 7. **Compliance with Canadian Laws** 

Canadian influencers are well acquainted with the regulations surrounding influencer marketing in their country. This means that they‚Äôll follow the rules, which is one less thing for brands to worry about.


## ‚ùó Local Regulations to Be Aware Of

While Canadian influencers are generally more familiar with their country‚Äôs regulations, American brands must be careful to ensure compliance as well. 

The Canadian Code of Advertising Standards requires influencers to disclose sponsored content that promotes a product or service. 

This includes social media posts like those on Facebook. 

The disclosure should be clear and conspicuous, and hashtags like #ad or #sponsored can be used. 


## üìö Conclusion

Facebook influencer promotions in Canada can be a great way for American brands to reach this lucrative market.

By knowing what to expect to pay for these services and how to find and partner with influencers, you can increase your chances of success. 

If you want to ensure success without having to do all the heavy lifting yourself, influencer marketing platforms and agencies like BaoLiba will do most of the work for you so you can focus on your core business.
