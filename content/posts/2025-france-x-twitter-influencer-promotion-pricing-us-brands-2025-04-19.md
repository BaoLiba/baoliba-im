As a US brand looking to promote your products or services on X in France in 2025, understanding the landscape of influencer pricing in France will be critical to your success.

In recent years, X has witnessed a significant surge in popularity among influencers and brands alike in France. With the meteoric rise of Instagram and TikTok, X has long been perceived as an underdog in the influencer marketing arena. However, by 2025, it is poised to become a titan, attracting a similar influencer audience as its rivals.

This increase in popularity will inevitably lead to higher fees being demanded by French influencers targeting French audiences on X in 2025. This article will delve into the details of influencer pricing on X in France in 2025 to ensure that you are well-prepared.

So buckle up, as we break down everything you need to know and start budgeting for influencer payments to French stars on X in 2025.


## üíµ Prices of X Influencers in France for 2025

One of the first critical points to understand is that influencer pricing varies between market tiers. For example, an influencer‚Äôs pricing and deliverables are determined by their audience size and engagement levels. 

To provide you with a general overview, we‚Äôve listed the average rates you can expect to pay French influencers on X in 2025 according to their tier. 


| X Influencer Tier | Average Price in 2025 (USD) |
|-------------------|------------------------------|
| Nano              | $339                         |
| Micro             | $555                         |
| Mid-Tier          | $893                         |
| Macro             | $1,215                         |
| Mega             | $2,098                         |


### üíª Why X Influencers Will Charge More in 2025

Despite being an established platform, X has only recently turned a corner on its road to influencer paradise. 

With X influencers in France charging an average of about **35% more** than YouTube and **6% more** than Instagram influencers in 2025, you might be asking yourself, ‚ÄúHow is this now happening?‚Äù 

There are several reasons as to why X influencers in France are charging more than their counterparts in the other platforms in 2025.


#### üèÉ Less Competition 

When it comes to the realm of influencers in France, X is still seen as a less competitive landscape than TikTok, Instagram, or YouTube.

For example, according to **Google**, in May 2023, search interest for both ‚ÄúTikTok influencer‚Äù and ‚ÄúInstagram influencer‚Äù as terms to set X influencers apart was **9x** larger than ‚ÄúX influencer‚Äù ‚Äî the term that would cover them all. 

This apparent lack of competition means that brands are more likely to turn to X influencers regardless of follower count due to a higher probability that they are the best person for the job. 

Of course, the bigger followers bode for a larger audience reach. But because there is less competition on X, influencers with smaller followings can still have a bigger impact when it comes to marketing campaigns. 

Thus, French influencers on X will be more likely to charge more to compensate for their perceived lower follower count than influencers on other platforms.


#### üí™ More Power to Influencers

Another reason why influencers in France will charge more in 2025 is that they will have more power and ownership over their content on X in comparison to TikTok and Instagram.

A **2023 study** by **Traackr**, which measured what influencers found most important in a platform, revealed that the most important feature was content ownership and rights. 

However, when it came to the platforms that excelled in delivering this, TikTok and Instagram fell short.

Unbeknownst to many, the fine print of TikTok and Instagram‚Äôs terms of service say that both platforms have broad rights to content posted on their platforms. In fact, they can monetize that user-generated content and are NOT obligated to pay the creator anything for that. 

According to the **2023 Traackr study**, this is NOT the case with X, where influencers can retain 100% of their rights to the content they create on the platform. 

This fact alone contributes to the higher perceived value of French influencers on X in 2025, thus allowing them to charge more.


#### üì∞ Brand Safety

Finally, brand safety will be another reason that French influencers on X in 2025 can charge more than their competitors on other platforms. 

In early 2023, before he was booted out, Elon Musk undertook a massive overhaul of Twitter that involved changing its name to X. 

This overhaul also saw X implement new policies and monitoring systems that were aimed at increasing brand safety. 

The results were that X saw a **25%** increase in brand safety perceptions by advertisers. 

All this means that French influencers on X will be seen as a more stable option than TikTok and Instagram counterparts when it comes to brand safety. 

Thus, allowing them to charge more in 2025.


## üìà The Future of Influencers on X in France

Despite some ups and downs in its existence, by 2025, X is very much in the running to become a top player among platforms for influencers. 

According to **Business Insider**, ad spend on X in France is set to **double** from 2024 to 2025 before projecting up to **30%** increases annually through to 2028. 

Even with this increase in ad spend, advertisers can expect to see much better ROI compared to platforms like TikTok and Instagram that have much higher prices for lower ROI.


#### üåç X Will Be More Global

In the future, X will also ride a trending wave in that it will become more global. 

In 2024, the average percentage of impressions seen in **Western Europe** from X influencers targeting Western European audiences is projected to be **6%**. 

This figure is predicted to grow to almost **14%** by 2028, meaning that by then, Western European audiences will see more relevant content from X influencers targeting them proportionate to the overall impressions. 


#### üîÑ Influencer Marketing Will Be More Relational

While influencer marketing has largely become transactional, X influencers in France will be more inclined towards the relational side of marketing. 

By **2030**, **Wunderman Thompson** predicts that influencer marketing will be about **50%** more relational than it currently is.

This means that brands will have to invest in influencers over the long term rather than just paying them for a one-off promotion. 


## üëá What You Need to Budget as a US Brand in 2025

While the figures we provided you with earlier are averages, the reality is that influencer pricing can vary widely based on various factors, including:

- The influencer's niche
- Audience size & engagement levels
- Current trends
- Deliverables
- Content format

This section will provide you with a quick and easy way to calculate how much you need to budget for an influencer on X in France in 2025.


### üí∞ Cost per Given Action (CPA)

The easiest way for you as a brand to determine an influencer's price on X is through a Cost per Given Action (CPA) model. 

To calculate the price based on a CPA model, you determine how much you are willing to pay for a certain objective, also known as the desired outcome. 

In the case of influencers, the objective can be as simple as getting a URL clicked. This means the influencer will embed a clickable link in their posts on X to direct traffic to a landing page you specify. 

The formula for the CPA model is: 
$$ 
Influencer Price = Desired Outcome / Average Conversion Rate 
$$ 

If you, for example, want to drive 1,000 clicks to your landing page from a French influencer on X in 2025, the formula would look like this:


$$ 
Influencer Price = 1,000 clicks / 2% 
$$ 

This means that you should be willing to pay **$50,000** for that influencer to achieve your desired outcome of driving 1,000 clicks. 


### üìà Cost per Engagement (CPE)

The second way to determine an influencer‚Äôs price is by using a Cost per Engagement (CPE) model. 

In this model, instead of determining a price based on a desired outcome, you base it on the amount you are willing to pay for each interaction with content the influencer creates on X. 

Using a CPE model can be beneficial as it offers a more tangible return on investment than just pure impressions. 

The formula for the Cost per Engagement model is:


$$ 
Influencer Price = Total Interactions x CPE 
$$ 


So, sticking with the previous example of an influencer embedding a URL link in their post on X, suppose you want to generate **1,000 impressions** and **100 clicks** on that link. 

The total interactions would equal the impressions + the clicks, which equals **1,100**. 

If you have determined that you are willing to pay **$1** per interaction, this means that you should be willing to pay **$1,100** to that influencer for them to create content on X. 


### üìÉ Cost per Post (CPP)

The third way, and the most straightforward model, is the Cost per Post (CPP) model. 

In this case, the influencer sets a price for how much they charge to create their content and post it on X. 

In this case, the valuation may depend on various factors such as:

- Niche
- Audience size
- Engagement levels
- Deliverables
- Content type, etc.


If you want to use this model, it is essential that both you and the influencer agree beforehand on also what the deliverables will be. 

For example, suppose you want them to create a video post and an image post on X. The influencer's price may be something like **$300** for the video post and **$200** for the image post. 

In this case, you should be prepared to pay that influencer **$500** to promote your brand on X.


### üìä How to Compare Prices in 2025

While Westernized platforms like TikTok and Instagram have been the foundation of influencer marketing, they will find themselves being overshadowed by X in the coming years. 

As a result, it will become increasingly difficult to compare prices between these platforms in regards to influencer promotions.

To ease this process, influencer pricing comparison tools will become commonplace for brands. 

These tools will help brands draw parallels between differences in influencer pricing, demographics, engagement, etc. across multiple platforms. 


## üë®‚Äçüè´ Key Takeaways

In summary, influencer pricing on X in France will be much higher in 2025 than it is now. 

As a brand looking to advertise on X in France, keep the following key points in mind:


- French influencers on X will cost **35% more** than YouTube and **6% more** than Instagram influencers in 2025.
