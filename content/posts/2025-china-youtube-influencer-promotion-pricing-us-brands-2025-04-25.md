China's YouTube market is booming!

With over 1 billion users, YouTube is the second most popular social platform worldwide after Facebook.

According to the 2023 China Internet Report by the China Internet Network Information Center (CINIC), China had 1.04 billion Internet users, of which 97.6% accessed the Internet through mobile devices. And 89.3% of mobile Internet users spent over 5 hours online.

In addition, the report mentions that 92.6% of users make purchases via the Internet. Some 772 million purchases were made through live-streaming last year, up from 2021's 586 million.

By 2025, the average cost for promoting a product on YouTube through a Chinese influencer could be as high as $3376.54, based on a BaoLiba forecast. This is a 68.90% increase from the 2024 average.

The following charts show the anticipated growth in promotional pricing from YouTube influencers in China for US brands through 2025:



## üí° China vs. USA YouTube Influencer Marketing Pricing

Although the pricing forecast indicates that promotional pricing among YouTube influencers in China is expected to increase, it now lags behind the pricing of similar influencers based in the USA.

In 2023, the average promotional pricing of a USA-based YouTube influencer was $5141.38. This figure is projected to grow to $7566.55 in 2025.

The chart shows that by 2025, the average cost of hiring a YouTube influencer from China will have only reached over half of the cost typically charged for similar promotional work by a USA-based influencer.

For instance, the forecast shows that hiring a professional YouTube influencer based in the USA will fetch an average promotional price of $4,336.95 in 2024. This figure is almost $1,000 more than the forecast price for hiring a Chinese-based influencer in 2025.

Chinese consumers spend lots of time online, especially on social media. Data shows that the average Chinese Internet user spends 31% of their time on social media, compared to an average of 22% for users in other countries.
