The global popularity of TikTok means influencer rates fluctuate worldwide, including in Thailand.

With the Thai economy still recovering from challenges posed by COVID-19 and world events, influencer promotions are more valuable than ever. Marketers are keen to ensure their investments are optimized.

So what can US brands expect to pay for TikTok influencer promotions in Thailand in 2025?

Let‚Äôs dive in.


## üìä Thai TikTok Influencer Rates

The leading influencer marketing agency in Thailand is KOL Thailand, which estimates rates based on influencers‚Äô follower counts. 

According to KOL Thailand, here‚Äôs what US brands can expect to pay for TikTok influencer promotions in Thailand in 2025:

- Micro-influencers (10,000 to 50,000 followers) - 10,000 to 25,000 THB ($290 to $725) for one post
- Mid-tier influencers (50,000 to 150,000 followers) - 25,000 to 50,000 THB ($725 to $1450) for one post
- Macro influencers (150,000 to 500,000 followers) - 50,000 to 100,000 THB ($1450 to $2900) for one post
- Mega influencers (over 500,000 followers) - 100,000 to 500,000 THB ($2900 to $14,500) for one post

Rates include the basic promotional post but can increase based on additional costs like production, usage rights, exclusivity, and social media cross-promotion.

These rates are generally consistent with other influencer marketing agencies in Thailand, including StarNgage and We Are Social.

If brands are interested in complete packages including video creation and promotion, rates can jump to 50,000 to 100,000 THB ($1450 to $2900) for micro-influencers, 100,000 to 200,000 THB ($2900 to $5800) for mid-tier influencers, and up to 1,000,000 THB ($29,000) for mega influencers.


## ü§≥ TikTok influencer rates differ from other platforms

While influencer rates are roughly consistent across social media platforms, TikTok influencers in Thailand can charge a premium.

US brands looking for influencer promotions on Instagram or YouTube can expect to pay about half of the costs associated with TikTok promotions in Thailand. 

For example, here‚Äôs a comparison of TikTok influencer rates in Thailand to Instagram and YouTube rates:

|Fellowers|      TikTok      |     Instagram      |      YouTube      |
|:----------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|
|10k-50k |10k - 25k THB|5k - 10k THB|5k - 10k THB|
|50k-150k |25k - 50k THB|15k - 30k THB|10k - 20k THB|
|150k-500k |50k - 100k THB|30k - 50k THB|20k - 40k THB|
|>500k |100k - 500k THB|50k - 150k THB|40k - 100k THB|

According to KOL Thailand, TikTok is an emerging platform in Thailand, which means many influencers have learned to monetize their channels only recently.

As a result, TikTok influencers in Thailand tend to have higher engagement rates than their counterparts on other platforms, and they command higher rates as a result.

KOL Thailand reports that TikTok influencers in Thailand achieve engagement rates of 15% to 20%. In comparison, Instagram influencers achieve rates of only 3% to 7%.




## üé• Expect additional costs for production and promotion

KOL Thailand‚Äôs influencer marketing pricing guide assumes brands want to pay for base influencer promotions only. 

If brands want more creative control, they can expect to pay significantly more.

For example, brands can pay influencers to create videos using their products, but they‚Äôll need to cover production costs.

Production costs can vary greatly but can reach as much as 20,000 THB ($580) for a simple promotional video.

Brands can also pay influencers to promote their TikTok videos on other platforms like Instagram and YouTube, or on the influencers‚Äô own channels. This can add at least 10,000 THB ($290) to the bill.

It‚Äôs a good idea for brands to check with influencers to clarify what is included in their packages. 


## üë• Why US brands should invest in Thai TikTok influencers

TikTok is one of the most popular social media apps in Thailand. It ranks second overall behind Facebook among the country‚Äôs most used platforms.

According to Statista, nearly 16 million people in Thailand use TikTok. That‚Äôs about 23% of the country‚Äôs population.

TikTok‚Äôs reach is even higher among younger demographics. Among those aged 16 to 64, 35% use the app‚Äîhigher than the global average of 23%.

TikTok‚Äôs popularity continues to grow in Thailand.

Analytics firm Pathmatics reports that Thailand ranked third in the number of TikTok ads served worldwide in 2022. The country is also growing its TikTok ad spending significantly, spending 1.2 billion baht on TikTok ads in 2022‚Äînearly 36 million USD.

As more brands advertise on the platform, competition is increasing for consumer attention. Research shows that consumers are more likely to engage with and trust recommendations from influencers than traditional ads, making influencer promotions a valuable strategy for US brands.

For example, a study by McKinsey found that consumers trust influencers 35% more than brands, and they engage with influencer content 11 times more than traditional ads.


## üíµ How US brands can pay Thai TikTok influencers

Western brands used to struggle to pay Thai influencers, as they typically paid via international wire transfer.

That‚Äôs still a valid option, but it can take days for funds to show up in influencer accounts.

In recent years, more payment service providers have entered the Thai market, allowing brands to offer influencers more convenient payment options.

For example, US brands can pay Thai influencers via PayPal, TransferWise, or Payoneer. 

While these options may have different fees and processing times, they generally allow for much faster transactions.

Brands should check with influencers to determine preferred payment methods and any fees that might be associated with them.


## üëè The legal side of influencer contracts in Thailand

While influencer contracts in Thailand generally follow the same standards as in the US, some key differences exist.

For example, contracts worth more than 1 million THB ($29,000) must be registered with the Thai Labor Department. Failure to do so can result in fines as well as invalidate the contract.

In addition, Thailand has a unique labor law that considers influencers to be employees if brands have significant creative control over their work.

That means brands that plan on having influencers follow specific scripts or other detailed instructions may need to cover employee benefits and insurance.

It‚Äôs a good idea for brands to consult with a local influencer marketing agency like KOL Thailand to ensure that contracts meet all requirements.


## üì¢ How US brands can find TikTok influencers in Thailand

The easiest way for US brands to find and partner with TikTok influencers in Thailand is to work with an influencer marketing agency that specializes in the Thai market.

Agencies can help brands identify the best influencers for their campaigns based on metrics like audience demographics and engagement rates.

Agencies also typically handle contracts, payments, and reporting, making them a convenient option for US brands.

The following influencer marketing agencies specialize in the Thai market:

- KOL Thailand
- We Are Social Thailand
- MullenLowe Thailand
- StarNgage Thailand

Brands can also find TikTok influencers in Thailand by using influencer marketing platforms. These platforms typically allow brands to post campaigns and influencers can apply to participate.

Influencer marketing platforms with a presence in Thailand include:

- HypeAuditor
- Upfluence
- Heepsy
- AspireIQ

Finally, brands can also find influencers directly on TikTok. Brands looking for niche influencers can find them this way, but it can take more time.

Brands can search TikTok using relevant hashtags to find influencers who create content related to their products or services.


## ‚ùóNavigating the black market of Thai influencer marketing

While influencer marketing is booming in Thailand, the market is also rife with fraud.

Influencers with fake followers or engagement are common, and some agencies sell access to influencers with spammy tactics.

According to KOL Thailand, brands can identify bogus influencers by avoiding certain red flags, such as:

- Unrealistic follower counts
- High engagement rates (over 30%)
- Sudden increases in followers
- Little or no audience interaction
- Followers from unusual countries (like Afghanistan, India, or Kenya)
- Generic comments like ‚ÄúNice post!‚Äù or ‚ÄúCool!‚Äù from followers

Brands can also use tools like HypeAuditor or Upfluence to check influencer metrics and determine authenticity.


## üëç Conclusion

With TikTok growing faster than any other social media platform throughout the world, brands must stay ahead of the curve by investing in influencer promotions.

In Thailand, TikTok influencers charge a premium compared to their counterparts on other platforms.

Brands can expect to pay anywhere from 10,000 THB ($290) to 500,000 THB ($14,500) for basic influencer promotions, depending on their follower counts.

Ultimately, it pays for brands to work with local influencer marketing agencies to ensure they get the best bang for their buck.
