## üìä What Factors Determine Sponsored Post Prices on Pinterest in Indonesia in 2025?

Given that promotional costs on Pinterest can vary so greatly, it is important for brands to understand what factors influencers take into consideration when determining their prices. 

Here are the three primary factors that can affect sponsored post pricing on Pinterest:

### 1. Influencer Audience Size

Although audience size or how many followers an influencer has is not the most important criteria for success in influencer marketing, it is still a significant factor most brands consider when evaluating Pinterest influencers. 

The more followers influencers have, the greater their ability to reach a wider audience, so they can often charge more for their promotional posts. In Indonesia, Pinterest influencers with over 1 million followers can charge anywhere from $60 to $900 for sponsored posts, depending on their engagement rates. 

### 2. Engagement Rates

In the world of influencer marketing, success is often determined by how engaged a social media influencer‚Äôs audience is. This means how well their audience interacts with their posts, whether that‚Äôs through likes, comments, shares, or saves. 

Brands love influencers with high engagement rates because it indicates that their audience listens to them and values their opinion. 

This is especially important on Pinterest, where the goal is to drive traffic back to the brand‚Äôs website, blog, or product pages. Higher engagement rates can lead to higher click-through rates, which translates to a higher return on investment (ROI) for brands. 

Check out below some influencers on Pinterest in Indonesia and their respective engagement rates:

| Name | Followers | Engagement Rate | Sponsored Post Cost |
| ---- | --------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| Arsy Viral | 1,074,389 | 59.57% | $319 |
| Astrid Wayan |  1,037,545 | 42.79% | $395 |
| Rizky Ragil | 1,031,826 | 44.05% | $346 |
| Galih | 1,028,565 | 35.8% | $554 |
| Heloise | 1,026,411 | 32.78% | $624 |

### 3. Quality of Work

The quality of an influencer‚Äôs work is another factor that can affect how much they charge brands for sponsored posts. Indonesian Pinterest influencers who have a consistent aesthetic, good lighting, and high-quality images can charge higher prices for their posts because they can provide more appealing and professional-looking content.

The quality of an influencer‚Äôs photography and content can greatly impact how audiences perceive a brand and its products. Brands can expect to pay anywhere from $45 to $550 for sponsored posts on Pinterest in Indonesia, depending on the influencer‚Äôs level of quality.

### 1. Sponsored Articles

Pinterest influencers can also charge brands for writing sponsored articles featuring their products, services, or website links. These articles can then be pinned to the influencer‚Äôs Pinterest boards to help drive even more traffic to the brand‚Äôs website.

Pinterest management services can include anything from creating boards to designing pins. Brands can expect to pay anywhere from $250 to $1,200 for these services, depending on how extensive the management services are.

## üí° How to Work with Pinterest Influencers in Indonesia in 2025?

### 1. Contacting Influencers Directly

### 2. Using an Influencer Marketing Platform
