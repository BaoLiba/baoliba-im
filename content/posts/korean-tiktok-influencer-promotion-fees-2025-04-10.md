You‚Äôve probably been watching Korea‚Äôs TikTok influencers, right? 

They make it look so easy. And you‚Äôre wondering if they‚Äôd be interested in marketing partnerships with your business, and how much they‚Äôd charge you, right?

It‚Äôs a big question to answer if your marketing agency has never worked with Korean influencers before.

But don‚Äôt worry. 

The rates that Korean TikTok influencers charge for marketing collaborations are pretty similar to what influencers in other countries charge. 

So you‚Äôre not going to be surprised or shocked at their prices.


## üè∑Ô∏è Who Are Korean TikTok Influencers?

Korea‚Äôs TikTok influencer scene is really buzzing right now. 

Korea is the 3rd largest country in TikTok downloads, with 37 million users and an average of 8.7 million videos created each month, which means the landscape is fertile for influencers to thrive.

TikTok influencers in Korea, like elsewhere in the world, are simply popular personalities on TikTok that have amassed many followers who enjoy and trust their content. 

They can be anyone from dancers and singers, to makeup enthusiasts, or even comedians.

They don‚Äôt have to be all beauty or fashion influencers. They can specialize in tech reviews or travel videos, or anything in between. 

They can also specialize in only one type of TikTok video, like POVs, or they can spread their content across multiple types.

But wherever they sit within the vast landscape of TikTok content, they will have followers and viewers who trust their content and opinions and will likely buy the products or services that they recommend. 


## üí∞ How Much Do Korean TikTok Influencers Charge?

Korean TikTok influencers charge between $500 and $15,000 per video for paid marketing or promotional collaborations. 

The price difference will depend on the influencer‚Äôs engagement rate and follower count, as well as their experience with advertising partnerships. 

Influencers with more than 2 million followers can charge as much as $15,000 each, while those with less than 100,000 followers will charge around $500 per TikTok video.

Here‚Äôs a more detailed breakdown:

- üßë‚Äçüé§ Billion follower accounts:  $15,000+
- üë©‚Äçüé§ 1 million+ followers: $1,000 to $9,000
- üßë‚Äçüé§ 500,000 to 1 million followers: $1,000 to $5,000
- üë©‚Äçüé§ 100,000 to 500,000 followers: $500 to $2,000



## üé® What Services Can They Provide?

Korean TikTok influencers can provide the same marketing services for your advertising campaign that influencer marketing specialists in other countries can.

Here‚Äôs a list of the services that you can expect them to provide for your partnership:

- **Product Reviews:** The influencer will create a TikTok video that showcases your product, explains its benefits, and demonstrates how it can be used. 
- **Product Demos:** The influencer will create a TikTok video that provides a detailed demonstration of how your product works and the features that it has.
- **Sponsored Content:** The influencer will include your product in their regular TikTok videos, featuring it prominently and presenting it in a positive light.
- **Challenges & Trends:** The influencer will create a trending TikTok video, but include your product and have it feature prominently in the clip.
- **Giveaways:** The influencer will create a TikTok video that promotes your product and encourages their audience to participate in a contest or giveaway in order to win it.


## üíÄ What‚Äôs The Downside Of TikTok Influencer Marketing?

Korean TikTok influencers face the same issues that influencers in other countries face when they decide to partner with brands to make money. 

Here‚Äôs a list of the main problems that can arise in these partnerships:

- **Fake Followers:** There‚Äôs always a chance that the influencer has purchased fake followers. This will cause a lack of engagement on your sponsored videos because the influencer won‚Äôt have as many real viewers as you thought they had.
- **Poor Quality Content:** The influencer might not produce the quality of content that you expected, which means your product won‚Äôt be portrayed in the best light, and it likely won‚Äôt convert viewers into sales.
- **Misleading Ad Copy:** The influencer might exaggerate your product‚Äôs capabilities in their marketing copy, which can mislead their audience and hurt your brand‚Äôs reputation.
- **Lack of Authenticity:** If the influencer has a history of collaborating with dozens of brands, their followers might see them as inauthentic and unwilling to buy anything they promote.
- **No Exclusivity:** Depending on the contract that you sign with the influencer, they might be allowed to work with your competitors and promote their products, which can hurt your sales.
