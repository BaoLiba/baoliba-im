## üö® The Impact of the Israel-Palestine Conflict on Social Media Influence

The recent influx of TikTok influencers from Gaza gaining fame with anti-semitic content has created an uptick in US brands looking to reassure their Israeli consumers that they stand with Israel.

Many US brands have been reaching out to influencers in Israel to gain access to their local audiences, which may be contributing to the rising prices. 

Brands are encouraged to keep these realities and the sentiments of social media audiences in mind when crafting marketing campaigns. 


## üí¨ What US Brands Should Know About Influencer Fees in Israel

While prices are relatively low for many brands, be sure to keep in mind several factors that will impact your bottom line when calculating TikTok influencer marketing costs.

1. **Short videos cost less.** The more work the influencer has to do, the more you will pay. Expect to pay a lot less for a simple shoutout than a video featuring a detailed tutorial showcasing your product.
   
2. **Packages save money.** Many TikTok influencers offer packages that bundle together several posts into one deal at a discount. This is often a great way to gain the trust of their audience when you maintain a presence on their feed over time.

3. **Instagram cross-posting is common.** Most TikTok influencers will post the video you paid for on their Instagram feed as well. This is a huge benefit when considering that Instagram influencers charge 69% more. 

4. **Branding rates.** An influencer will often offer discounts to keep your product visible in their feed over an extended period of time. For example, an influencer may place your logo on their shirt or hat in every video they make for a month. This is a great strategy for boosting brand recognition.

5. **Engagement counts.** The size of an influencer‚Äôs audience is just one metric to consider. Engagement is also critical. Sometimes, a smaller creator can command a premium because they have built a loyal following that appreciates their niche talents. 

## üëë Israeli TikTok influencer marketing is the best option for US brands

For 2025, US brands are encouraged to take advantage of the unique opportunities offered by Israeli TikTok influencers. 

With premium content available at bargain prices, it‚Äôs hard to resist the countless advantages of including these creators in your advertising mix.
