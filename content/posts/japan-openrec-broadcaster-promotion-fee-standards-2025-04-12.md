Japan's OpenRec platform has emerged as a significant player in influencer marketing, particularly for video game-focused brands targeting the Japanese market. As the platform continues to grow in popularity, brands are becoming increasingly interested in collaborating with OpenRec influencers to engage Japanese gamers effectively. But how much does an average OpenRec influencer charge for promotional collaborations?

When it comes to OpenRec influencer pricing, it varies greatly depending on the influencer's level of authority and the type of collaboration they offer. It's important to note that Japanese OpenRec influencers typically charge in yen instead of US dollars, so prices may seem relatively more affordable to American brands. To get a better idea of how much OpenRec influencers charge for promotions, I dug into pricing data from Japanese influencer marketing platforms and presented it below.

## üéÆ OpenRec Influencer Pricing Data

According to detailed pricing data from Japanese influencer marketing firm, A8.net, OpenRec influencers typically charge around 3,650,000 yen for a single stream, while the cost of product placement in a stream is often around 4,200,000 yen on average. Meanwhile, charging for ongoing campaigns, like YouTube sponsorships, can sometimes range around 900,000 yen for every 30 seconds of video. 

### OpenRec Marketing Pricing 
- **Single Stream**: 3,650,000 yen
- **Product Placement**: 4,200,000 yen
- **YouTube Sponsorship**: 900,000 yen (per 30 seconds) 

Overall, Japanese OpenRec influencers charge between 850,000 and 8,000,000 yen for promotions on average. As with any influencer marketing, there are various factors that may affect pricing, which we discuss in detail below.

## üìä Factors Affecting OpenRec Influencer Pricing

OpenRec influencer pricing is highly variable and can range from as low as 850,000 yen to as high as 8,000,000 yen and, in some cases, even higher. While the average prices mentioned above are based on data from numerous influencers, actual costs may vary significantly based on several factors.

### ‚≠ê Influencer Authority 

Influencer authority is arguably the most significant factor affecting OpenRec influencer pricing. Authority typically encompasses a combination of metrics, including the number of followers, stream average views, and overall engagement. The greater the authority level of an OpenRec influencer, the higher their pricing often becomes.

While followers and views may seem like the most obvious metrics, it‚Äôs essential to pay attention to engagement levels with any influencer. An influencer may have a million followers, but if only a small portion of those followers consistently engage with their content, that influencer's authority may not be as high as you think. 

### üéØ Content Type 

The type of content or promotions that an OpenRec influencer offers also significantly impacts pricing. For example, a single stream featuring a brand's game may come with a higher charge than just a periodic mention by the influencer across their account. 

Incorporating different content formats can also result in varying prices. For instance, an OpenRec influencer may charge one rate for an image post about a brand's game and another rate for a video showcasing the gameplay. So, if you're looking to promote your game through OpenRec influencers, consider what content types will best achieve your campaign goals and budget accordingly.

### üîÅ Campaign Duration 

Influencer campaigns that last longer than a single post or stream generally come at a significantly lower cost than one-off promotions. For example, instead of paying 5 million yen for a single stream, brands may pay a monthly rate of 3 million yen for a month-long OpenRec influencer partnership. 

In essence, paying a higher one-time fee for an OpenRec influencer may yield better immediate results, but investing in a longer-term partnership could provide brands with greater overall value in the long run. Either way, it‚Äôs essential to clearly communicate your vision with influencers and establish campaign milestones to ensure accountability.

### üí∞ Payment Terms 

OpenRec influencers may offer flexibility when it comes to payment methods, but it's not uncommon for influencers to require upfront payments or deposit fees when collaborating with brands. This is especially true for influencers with high authority levels, as they may receive a high volume of requests from brands and want to ensure their time is compensated properly. 

That being said, upfront payment or deposit fees offered by OpenRec influencers can make a difference in promotions pricing. Offering to pay upfront is usually a good way to negotiate lower fees for a campaign, as influencers may view that as a fair trade-off for the guaranteed payment.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Brand Category 

The category that a brand falls under can influence the pricing offered by OpenRec influencers. For example, beauty and fashion brands may be accustomed to higher influencer fees than game brands. 

Interestingly, there are some indications that OpenRec influencers may be less open to collaboration with gaming brands. According to a survey conducted by Japanese influencer marketing firm A8.net, gaming brands ranked the lowest in the types of companies OpenRec influencers would like to partner with. With that said, brands in other categories may have greater luck getting ahead in the line when collaborating with OpenRec influencers.

### üíº Profile Management

OpenRec influencers that have their profiles managed by agency companies may charge higher prices than those who manage their profiles independently. This is likely due to the fact that agencies often have a wealth of experience navigating promotional collaborations, which can result in better results for the brand. 

When working with OpenRec influencers, it can be essential to inquire about whether they are agency-managed or independent and how that may affect pricing. 

## ‚ùó The Need for OpenRec Influencers

Whether a brand is looking to engage a gaming audience in Japan or simply wants to work with OpenRec influencers, the costs associated with influencer marketing can be significant. However, the potential returns on investment can make these expenses worthwhile.

In a study conducted by the Japan Business Federation in 2022, 52 percent of surveyed companies that actively engaged in influencer marketing reported a positive impact on sales. Additionally, over 70 percent of those companies indicated they would continue to invest more in influencer marketing in the future. 

Investing in OpenRec influencers may be a smart move for brands targeting Japanese gamers.
