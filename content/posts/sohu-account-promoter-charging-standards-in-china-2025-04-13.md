When considering influencer marketing in China, American advertisers often overlook Sohu. Despite being one of the oldest and most influential social media platforms in the country, information regarding influence collaborations on Sohu remains scarce.

In this article, I will break down the pricing structure for Sohu influencer collaborations, providing you with a better understanding of how much such campaigns will cost in 2025.

## üì± What Is Sohu?

Founded in 1998, Sohu is one of the earliest internet brands in China. It is a traditional media platform that has been among the top five web companies in the country for over a decade.

Sohu ranks within the top 10 most visited websites in China, with an average of 250 million monthly visitors and 276 million mobile monthly visitors.

Furthermore, the Sohu app accounts for more than 10 million of the media hub‚Äôs daily active users (DAU). For reference, the 10 million DAU figure places the platform above other major players on the list like Twitter, Reddit, and Twitch.

Sohu‚Äôs primary content categories include news, entertainment, sports, finance, and real estate. Its major competitors include Baidu, Tencent, and NetEase.

Sohu also operates several popular sub-platforms, including Sohu Sports, Sohu Finance, Sohu Property, and Sohu Video.

## üí≥ Sohu Influencer Marketing Rates

No clear pricing structure exists for collaborations with influencers on Sohu. However, a report from 2023 indicated that video advertisements on the Sohu platform can range between $25,000 and $50,000.

The majority of high-profile KOLs on Sohu charge between $1,000 and $5,000 for each post, with more expensive collaborations often including multiple posts across multiple Sohu sub-platforms. Some of the most popular KOLs on Sohu can demand more than $10,000 for a single post.

The article did not detail the specific deliverables included in these collaborations, so I recommend reaching out to KOLs and agencies directly to verify current pricing for your specific campaign needs.

Please note that those prices were for officials Sohu influencers, not just any random accounts. These official accounts can range from individuals to institutions, all distinguished by a blue or yellow badge next to their handles.

## üí° Key Sohu Influencer Types

Sohu influencers are classified into five main categories:

1. **Sohu Video** - These influencers share video content on Sohu‚Äôs video platform. Collaboration pricing generally ranges between $2,000 and $10,000.

2. **Sohu Knowledge** - These Sohu influencers share academic or educational insights. Pricing for these collaborations generally ranges between $1,500 and $5,000.

3. **Sohu News** - These influencers are experts in disseminating news content on Sohu. Collaborating with them generally costs between $1,000 and $5,000.

4. **Sohu Public Account** - These influencers share information and insights through Sohu‚Äôs public account feature. Collaborations typically range between $1,000 and $5,000.

5. **Sohu Group** - These influencers operate within Sohu groups, which are sub-communities or forums. Influencer marketing collaborations with these KOLs generally range from $300 to $2,000.

Despite the apparent range of pricing, the rates quoted previously reflect those of the most well-known KOLs and institutions. Lesser-known influencers outside the top tier are generally cheaper and may charge around $300 for a single post.

Additionally, many prices are negotiable, and different KOLs may offer different deliverables for the same price.

## üíµ Payment Methods for Sohu Influencer Collaborations

Aside from pricing, payment methods are also an important consideration before collaborating with any Sohu influencers. The most popular methods among Sohu influencers include WeChat, Alipay, and bank transfers.

Both WeChat and Alipay are owned by Chinese internet titans Tencent and Alibaba respectively. Collectively, they account for more than 90% of mobile payments in China.

If you‚Äôre not using either of these popular mobile payment services already, you‚Äôll need to set them up for any collaborations.

WeChat allows users to send and receive money, pay bills, shop online, and more, all while remaining inside the app. To top that off, it also serves as a social media platform, messaging service, and video streaming service.

Try to think of it as a hybrid service that combines features from Venmo, Instagram, TikTok, and Uber Eats. This is also the reason for its popularity; users don‚Äôt have to leave the app for anything.

WeChat Pay is just one of many mini-programs offered within the WeChat app. It allows users to send and receive money with a few taps.

Alipay is like WeChat in that it allows users to send and receive money. However, it‚Äôs not a part of any messaging app; it‚Äôs its own standalone platform. 

Most major retailers and online shops accept both WeChat and Alipay, so you can‚Äôt go wrong with either one. However, if you wish to expand your influencer marketing in 2025, I‚Äôd recommend finding a way to set up both payment methods.

Bank transfers are a more traditional approach to payments. However, keep in mind that processing times can be longer, and you may also incur international transfer fees when sending money from the U.S. to China.

## ‚ùó Risks of Collaborating With Influencers on Sohu

While influencer marketing on Sohu can be lucrative, it‚Äôs important to note that it does carry risks. According to an article from the Global Times, several top influencers on Sohu and other Chinese platforms have been caught engaging in fraudulent practices.

One example highlighted in the report was that of a Sohu influencer who falsely claimed to own a luxury apartment in Beijing. This Sohu influencer was eventually fined $21,000 for the fraud.

Moreover, according to an article from Statista, Sohu ranked 23rd in the top 50 Chinese websites ranked by the number of suspicious accounts discovered. This means that a significant number of Sohu accounts may not be authentic, including influencers.

For that reason, I highly encourage you to only work with influencers who are officially recognized by Sohu. Remember, look for that blue or yellow badge next to their handle. 

You should also conduct due diligence into the influencers you wish to collaborate with, regardless of their official status.

## üì¢ Sohu Is an Effective Platform for Influencer Marketing

Sohu influencers can provide a key opportunity for brands looking to enhance their presence and impact in China. They can help you navigate the complex digital landscape of that country more easily than traditional advertising methods.

Despite the language and cultural differences, Sohu KOLs can communicate your brand‚Äôs message to the Chinese audience more effectively.

As with any influencer marketing campaigns, however, it‚Äôs important to collaborate with Sohu KOLs who align with your brand‚Äôs image and target audience.
