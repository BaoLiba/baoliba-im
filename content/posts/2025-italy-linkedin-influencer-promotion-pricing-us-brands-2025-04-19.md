Italian influencers on LinkedIn are expected to charge an average of $1,150 per endorsement in 2025, according to projections from BaoLiba Global Influencer Marketing Agency.

### üë©‚Äçüíª LinkedIn is the platform of choice for Italian influencers

While many Italian influencers operate across various platforms such as TikTok, Instagram and YouTube, the majority of them are not considered trend-setters, according to a report on Italy content creators by digital marketing agency The Wise Crowd.

The Wise Crowd remarked that ‚Äúwhen it comes to cutting-edge LinkedIn tactics, Italians are the trend-setters on the platform‚Äù.

This is the driving factor for international brands that want to promote their products in Italy through influencer marketing to turn to Italian influencers on LinkedIn.

### üí∞ Pricing per endorsement has increased 15% since 2023

Due to the demand from American brands for Italian influencers on LinkedIn, influencer pricing on the platform has risen 15% compared to the average of $1,000 per endorsement in 2023.


According to BaoLiba projections, from 2025 onward, prices will stabilize around $1,150 per endorsement.

### üí° How influencer pricing is determined

Brands can expect to pay for influencer marketing on LinkedIn based on the following factors:
 
- **Engagement Rate:** The more engagement an influencer can receive on a post, the higher the price a brand will have to pay.  
- **Followers:** The number of followers an influencer has is a consideration too, but unless they are a LinkedIn superstar or strong thought leader, overall follower count is less of a consideration compared to other platforms such as Instagram. 
- **Content Quality:** High-quality content takes longer to create, and therefore requires more investment from brands. 
- **Niche Expertise:** Niche experts can charge more than mass appeal influencers. 
- **Speed of Production:** Instant posts may come at a lower cost than posts that take time to produce.
- **Copy Rights:** Brands may have a need to use the content created by the influencer across their other marketing channels which may drive up costs.

### üìä Cost breakdown

Assuming an average pricing of $1,150 per endorsement for Italian influencers on LinkedIn, then brands can expect to pay for various aspects of an endorsement post as follows:

- **Content Creation:** $450 
- **Technical Set Up:** $400
- **Posting/Sharing:** $300

### üì¢ The average campaign cost will be about $4,000

While the price of one endorsement post from an Italian influencer on LinkedIn averages out to $1,150, a brand typically does not just run one endorsement post.

Brands should expect to pay around $4,000 for a full campaign run by one Italian influencer on LinkedIn.
