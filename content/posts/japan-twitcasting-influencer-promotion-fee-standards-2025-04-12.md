When it comes to influencer marketing, whether it's TikTok, Instagram, or YouTube, the way influencers find businesses to work with is relatively the same across all platforms. Brands reach out to influencers to pitch collaboration ideas, influencers vet offers, and they negotiate prices for sponsored content placement.

But what if I told you that Japan has their own live-streaming platform full of influencers with a vastly different approach to influencer marketing, and it‚Äôs called TwitCasting?

If you‚Äôre an American brand looking to enter the Japanese market, or an influencer looking to collaborate with TwitCasting influencers, you‚Äôll need to know how pricing works on this platform.

# üí∏ Pricing Standards For TwitCasting Influencers
A 2022 Statista report revealed that over 95% of Japanese people have consumed live-streaming content, making it one of the most popular forms of media in the country. 

And it‚Äôs not hard to see why. TwitCasting influencers began their careers as amateurs, leveraging one of the most beloved aspects of Japanese culture ‚Äî karaoke ‚Äî to build their audiences. 

Today, they pull in stronger engagement numbers than other established platforms like YouTube and Instagram, with users spending an average of 137 minutes a day on the app, compared to 82 minutes on YouTube and 61 minutes on Instagram. 

The affinity for live-streaming has only grown in recent years as younger generations flock to streaming platforms for their media consumption, with Statista projecting that global revenues from live-streams will reach over $184 billion by 2027.

As such, working with influencers on TwitCasting is an attractive marketing opportunity for brands looking to reach Japanese consumers. 

But how do you know if you‚Äôre paying a fair price for these collaborations? And how do you go about negotiating them? 

Let‚Äôs break it down.

## üé§ What Is TwitCasting?
TwitCasting is a live-streaming platform that allows users to broadcast their videos directly to Twitter. 

It was created in 2010 by  Masato Sato, who has said that his goal for creating TwitCasting was not to compete with YouTube, but to allow people to connect with others in ways they couldn‚Äôt with text alone.

Although streams can be viewed without an account, interested viewers need to sign up so they can send comments and ‚Äúcoins‚Äù, the platform‚Äôs currency that streamers can use to buy perks like decorations and tools for their broadcast. 

Coins can also be converted into cash and withdrawn, incentivizing users to build audiences. 

Given that Japan is a country that prides itself on karaoke, it‚Äôs no surprise that many users opt to use these features to host karaoke sessions, with half of all their streaming content being karaoke-related. 

The platform has operated on a free and freemium model for years, allowing users to stream for free while charging those who want access to features like an advertising-free experience and the ability to watch replays. 

As of 2023, TwitCasting has over 9 million users and sees over 2.7 million broadcasts a month, with 6.9 billion total views since its inception. 

## üßë‚Äçüé§ Characteristics of TwitCasting Influencers
When it comes to identifying TwitCasting influencers, you‚Äôll want to look out for the following characteristics. 

### They‚Äôre mostly male
While most live-streaming platforms cater to a mix of both genders, 60% of TwitCasting users are men, and so are 60% of the influencers. 

60% of influencers on most platforms are women. But not on TwitCasting. The average streamer is a 20-40-year-old male who uses the platform to showcase his karaoke talents.

### They‚Äôre mostly young
Like many other live-streaming platforms, TwitCasting has an overwhelmingly young demographic. 

According to a 2022 survey conducted by Japanese investment bank, Nomura, 57% of users are aged between 10-20 years. 

Today‚Äôs youth are not only consuming but becoming creators in larger numbers than ever before. This makes influencer marketing an attractive channel for brands trying to reach younger consumers.

## üìä Pricing Standards On TwitCasting
We‚Äôve gone over what TwitCasting is and what its influencers are like, but how much can you expect to pay them for collaborations? 

Thanks to influencer marketing platform, baoliba.com, we know the average pricing standards for TwitCasting influencers for 2025 to be the following:


| **Collaboration Type** | **Average Price** | **Notes** |
|----------------|:------------------:|-----------------------------|
| Paid shoutout | $37 | Influencer mentions and/or showcases product in their stream. |
| Product placement | $51 | Influencer uses or features product prominently in their stream. |
| Sponsored stream | $64 | Influencer hosts a stream with some promotional content. |
| Full sponsorship | $118 | Influencer creates multiple promotional streams with brand messaging. |

As you can see from the table, on average, brands can expect to pay about $65 for TwitCasting influencer marketing collaborations in 2025.    

While this is an attractive figure compared to influencer pricing on other platforms, brands should keep in mind that, like every other platform, influencer pricing on TwitCasting is not a one-size-fits-all proposition. 

## üö® Negotiating Prices With TwitCasting Influencers
If you want to get the most bang for your buck with TwitCasting influencer marketing, you need to know how to negotiate prices with the influencers you want to work with. 

### Don‚Äôt treat them like traditional influencers 
Unless you have previous experience with Japanese influencers, you should avoid employing the traditional playbook for negotiating prices with TwitCasting influencers. 

As stated before, most TwitCasting influencers operate on a freemium model, meaning that they already have a built-in way to monetize their audience. This means they may not have the same accounting for their time as you‚Äôd expect from other influencers who rely on sponsorships for income.

### Know that they expect tips
TwitCasting influencers receive a large portion of their income from tips, and they‚Äôll want you to take this into account when negotiating prices with them. 

In fact, they typically expect brands to tip them as part of their collaboration fees. 

This is because tipping is a standard practice for streamers on TwitCasting, and they take it personally when brands don‚Äôt tip them. This is especially true for streamers who have a background in customer service jobs, such as waiters ‚Äî a familiar profession in Japanese culture.

### Number of viewers matters 
A common denominator in influencer pricing across platforms is audience size. 

For TwitCasting influencers, this can manifest in two ways: the average number of viewers they get per stream, and the number of followers they have on the platform. 

Brands can expect to pay more for influencers who consistently have large audiences. 

### Negotiate based on results
The most effective way to negotiate prices with TwitCasting influencers is to allow other brands to be the bad guy. 

Brands that reach out to influencers will often use a D2C model that requires them to waive collaboration fees so that they can tout how they got a notable influencer to represent their brand.

But what happens is that influencers will negotiate their prices down to accommodate these brands, and they may not have the same flexibility for your brand when you reach out to them. 

To avoid this, you can work with an influencer marketing agency, like baoliba.com, to reach out to influencers on your behalf. 

Since agencies typically charge brands a fee to cover their costs, they have room for negotiation that brands like yours may not have. 

Therefore, by working through an agency, you can help ensure that influencers are charging closer to their fair market value in prices for collaborations instead of deeply discounting them.

## üìà Wrap Up
If you want to enter the Japanese market through influencer marketing, you‚Äôll need to know how to price your collaborations with TwitCasting influencers. 

Expect to pay around $65 for collaborations on average, and account for tips. 

By working with an influencer marketing agency, you can further ensure that your prices are fair for both parties.
