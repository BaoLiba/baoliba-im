Contrary to popular belief, there is a thriving influencer culture in Romania, particularly on LinkedIn.

LinkedIn influencer marketing is a relatively new phenomenon in Romania, which means that the available talent is still largely untapped. 

Why should you care? Because US brands looking to penetrate the Romanian market can tap into this wealth of talent inexpensively and effectively.

As much as it is easy to dismiss Romania as a poor and underdeveloped country, it currently has some of the fastest-growing economies in Europe. Romania's economy is set to grow by 4.5% in 2025, surpassing the EU average of 3.1%. 

What this means is that a significant number of Romanians are entering the middle class. In 2021, 48% of Romanians belonged to the middle class. This number is forecasted to grow to 61% by 2030. 

Romanians are quickly adopting Western consumer habits, making them an attractive market for US brands. 

Many Romanian influencers are bilingual, making it easy for them to promote your products in English. 

Perhaps the best thing about Romanian influencers is the fact that their services come cheap. 

In this article, we will discuss how much Romanian LinkedIn influencers charge for their services in 2025.

## üìä How Romanian LinkedIn Influencers Are Different From US Influencers 

Romanian influencers generally have a more professional approach to marketing than their American counterparts. 

Typically, Romanian influencers have full-time jobs in reputable companies that they promote in their influencer capacity. 

Because of the nature of LinkedIn, most of these influencers have substantial experience in their respective industries, which makes them experts. 

Compared to American influencers, Romanian influencers can bring a level of professionalism that audiences on LinkedIn expect. 

While American influencers are known for their flashy and often fake lifestyle, influencers from Romania bring authenticity and experience that they earned from years of hard work. 

When targeting the Romanian market, this approach is much more effective. 

## üí∞ Pricing for Romanian LinkedIn Influencers

The average cost of Romanian LinkedIn influencers in 2025 is expected to range between $100 and $500 per post. 

The exact amount will depend on several factors, including the influencer's level of experience and audience engagement rates. 

Typically, the more followers an influencer has, the more they charge for their services. Influencers with more than 100,000 followers are expected to charge an average of $2,500 per post. 

On the lower end of the spectrum, niche influencers with less than 10,000 followers generally charge between $50 and $300 per post.

## üìà Romanian LinkedIn Influencers Can Provide High ROI

Although Romanian LinkedIn influencers charge much less than their American counterparts, they can provide an even higher ROI. 

According to a report by the Romanian Association of Communication Agencies (UAPR), 50% of Romanian consumers have purchased a product or service after seeing it promoted by an influencer. 

This statistic is significant, especially considering that Romanian influencers charge less than 1/5 of what American ones charge on average. 

In the United States, the average cost of an influencer marketing campaign is $1,000 to $1,500 per sponsored post. 

Furthermore, Romanian influencers can be much more relatable for Romanian consumers than American influencers. 

According to a report by Statista, 59% of Romanian consumers trust influencers from their own country more than international influencers, despite the latter being more prominent. 

This can present a challenge for US brands targeting Romanian consumers through American influencers.

For example, Romanian law requires influencers to disclose sponsored posts clearly. 

This means that influencers must include a clear and conspicuous disclosure that the post is sponsored.

Failure to comply with these laws can result in fines for both the influencer and the brand.
