When marketing products in China, it is important to understand the platforms your audience is using and how to best reach them. Douyin (the Chinese version of TikTok) is one of the most powerful social media platforms for product marketing in China.

To get started with Douyin influencer marketing, brands based in the United States need to learn how to collaborate with Douyin influencers and how much they charge for marketing their products through Douyin.

## üìä Understanding the Douyin Market

This multi-faceted app has exploded in popularity in China, with over 600 million active users. A large percentage of Chinese netizens from ages 18-24 use Douyin daily, making it an important and relevant platform for brands seeking to reach the Chinese market.

Douyin allows users to create short videos with popular music and sound clips. Content varies widely, but user-generated content (aka UGC) tends to be more authentic and genuine than advertising. Douyin influencers build their audiences through entertaining and relatable content. Brands leverage their skill at audience engagement by working with influencers that align with their brand image and marketing goals.

Douyin influencers have an average engagement rate of 14.49% and are considered some of the most effective influencers in the world. By tapping into the Douyin influencer market, brands can create authentic content that resonates with potential customers.

Douyin influencers can showcase products firsthand in their videos, provide recommendations, and even include links to external sites to drive instant traffic to a brand‚Äôs store. 

With an audience that craves entertainment, collaboration with Douyin influencers is the best way to showcase products organically, while aligning with cultural interests.

## üí∞ Douyin Influencer Marketing Costs 

The pricing for marketing through Douyin influencers can vary widely depending on the number of followers an influencer has, their niche, and the details of the collaboration. 

Douyin influencer collaboration prices start around $550 and can go into the tens of thousands per post. On average, brands can expect to pay around $3,800 for a Douyin influencer post. 

There are three main tiers of Douyin influencer pricing:

- **Small-scale influencers (up to 100,000 followers)** charge between $550 and $2,400 per post. 
- **Mid-range influencers (100,000 - 1 million followers)** charge between $1,800 and $13,500 per post. 
- **Top-tier influencers (over 1 million followers)** charge between $6,800 and $38,000 per post. 

These prices do not include any production costs or extras, and they are only for a single post on Douyin. Brands may expect to pay a little less for short-term campaigns, but overall prices will remain consistent.

Pricing for Douyin influencer marketing is often similar to those for Western influencers, but it is important to note that Douyin influencers and TikTok influencers are not interchangeable. 

While TikTok has a wide reach and is available in many countries, Douyin‚Äôs audience is highly concentrated in China. Douyin influencers must cater to the interests of a Chinese audience, which requires content that may not be as relevant to TikTok audiences. Brands marketing in the Chinese market must go the extra mile to collaborate with a Chinese influencer.

## üìù Douyin Influencer Collaboration Deals

Brands seeking to work with a Douyin influencer can opt for either sponsored posts or product exchanges. 

Sponsored posts are straightforward and allow influencers to create original content around a brand‚Äôs product or service. Influencers will often share their honest opinions and provide recommendations, which builds trust with their audience. Sponsored posts also typically come with affiliate links, which allow brands to analyze traffic and conversions from their influencer partnerships.

On the other hand, product exchanges are less formal and might include influencers simply unboxing a product on camera or wearing it in a different video. These collaborations require less commitment from influencers but also less assurance that brands will secure their desired marketing results.

Overall, it is advisable for brands to invest in sponsored posts to maximize their return on investment.

## üí≥ Payment Methods for Douyin Influencer Marketing

In many ways, payments for Douyin influencer marketing are the same as they are in the United States. Brands usually pay upfront through a third-party payment app, like Alipay or WeChat Pay.

It is important to note that most Chinese influencers prefer to be paid in RMB instead of US dollars. Brands should take the necessary steps to understand how to convert payments and remit them through their preferred payment methods.

## üåê How to Collaborate with Douyin Influencers 

In the United States, brands often coordinate influencer campaigns through influencer marketing agencies. This is a valid option for brands marketing in China, but it may not be the best fit. 

Working with influencer marketing agencies may require contacting multiple agencies, negotiating contracts, and dealing with communications between three parties: the agency, the influencer, and the brand. 

Due to the cultural difference at play when marketing in China, it is typically best for Western brands to work directly with Chinese influencers.

Brands can leverage marketing platforms, like BaoLiba, to connect with influencers directly.
