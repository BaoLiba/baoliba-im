### üí° Factors Influencing Vietnam Facebook Influencer Pricing

Here are some of the most influential factors affecting the pricing of Facebook influencers in Vietnam in 2025. 

#### Audience Size and Engagement Rate

As with every influencer marketing campaign, the pricing of Facebook influencers in Vietnam is directly correlated to their audience size and engagement rate.

The higher these metrics are, the more influencers can leverage them to negotiate for better rates.

Nano influencers typically have an audience size of 100 to 5,000 followers, while mega influencers have an audience size of more than 1 million followers.

#### Niche

The niche that influencers operate in also plays a key role in determining their pricing in Vietnam.

For instance, influencers in the technology, finance, and education sectors can charge substantially more than influencers in beauty, lifestyle, and travel sectors. 

This is because brands in high-value niches are willing to spend more on influencer marketing campaigns.

#### Content Type

The format of the content that the influencer will create is another factor that affects how much they will charge.

For example, influencers who create video content usually charge more than influencers who create simple image posts. 

Likewise, the complexity of the content that needs to be created will also add to the influencer's charges. 

#### Deliverables

The total number of deliverables that the influencer needs to provide will also determine their charges. 

For instance, an influencer who creates two posts, three stories, and a video will charge more than an influencer who creates just one post.

#### Exclusivity

If the influencer promotes competing brands, they will generally charge lower fees for their services. 

However, if the brand wants to lock down the influencer for a specific period of time, they will usually have to pay a premium price for exclusivity.
