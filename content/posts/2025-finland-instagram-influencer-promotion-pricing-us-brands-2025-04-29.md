As outlandish as it seems, Finland has come to be a hub of influencer marketing. With Finland outperforming the rest of Europe in influencer marketing growth and engagement, US brands looking to expand into Finland need to know how much influencer marketing costs in Finland in 2025.

Finland has shown itself to be a beacon of digital and influencer marketing success in Europe. In 2023, Finland ranked first among EU nations in terms of social media engagement and influencer marketing penetration.

Just as the Nordic countries are known for their natural beauty, Finnish influencers are also recognized for their stunning looks and gorgeous looks. The country has produced a large number of top-tier influencers in the fashion and lifestyle sectors. 

According to Instagram's own statistics, Finland was recently ranked as the number one country in the EU for Instagram usage per capita. With 39% of the entire Finnish population actively using Instagram, it's little wonder that influencer marketing has taken off there.

35% of Finns use Instagram at least once a day, making it one of the most popular social media platforms across the country. This is all the more interesting considering that Facebook and TikTok have both recently been banned in the country due to national security concerns.

With Finland's recent rise in influencer marketing prominence, it's important to see what influencer pricing looks like in Finland for US brands looking to expand into this rapidly growing market. 



## üìä Finland Influencer Pricing in 2025


According to a recent report by the influencer marketing platform, HypeAuditor, the average cost for a paid post by an influencer in Finland is about $338. This is more than $100 below the average price of $444 across Europe.

Despite Finland's emergence as a leader in both social media and influencer marketing, the prices for influencers there remain very low compared to the rest of Europe. 

While influencer pricing in Europe varies widely among the different nations, Finland ranks among the ten cheapest European countries for influencers.

Prices for influencers are so low in Finland that the country ranks 6th among European nations for the least expensive influencers. The only countries that have lower influencer pricing on average are Hungary, Slovenia, Serbia, Slovakia, and Romania.

With influencer marketing costs being so low across the board, it is important for brands to know what influencer pricing looks like specifically in Finland.

- Mid-tier influencers (10K - 100K): $357 per post
- Macro influencers (100K - 1M): $1,254 per post

From the pricing outlined above, we can see that the average cost of a post for micro influencers is $130, while a macro influencer can charge $1,254. As with most markets, the more followers an influencer has, the more they can charge for a post. 


### Influencer Pricing Comparison

In Finland, mega influencers charge just $4,146 on average.  This is $5,932 less than the average price for a mega influencer across Europe. 


### Why Is Influencer Pricing in Finland So Low?

Despite Finland's recent rise in popularity in the influencer marketing world, it's clear that influencers there are still charging very low prices compared to their counterparts in other European nations. 

This could be due to a number of factors. For one, the influencer marketing industry in Finland is still relatively young compared to other places in Europe. 

While many European nations have been using influencer marketing as a business strategy for years, Finland has only just begun to capitalize on this lucrative sector. 

Additionally, many of the most famous influencers in Finland came up through the ranks of being bloggers. Although many of them have now transitioned to becoming professional influencers, they may still be charging low rates as they adjust to their new status.

## ‚ùó Finland Influencer Marketing Laws  

Finland has recently become a leader in influencer marketing, and much of this success can be attributed to the country's transparent laws and regulations regarding influencer advertising. 

In Finland, influencers are required by law to clearly disclose any and all paid partnerships or advertising. 

The Finnish Consumer Agency has issued guidelines stating that influencers must use clear and recognizable terms to indicate when they are being compensated for promoting a product or service. 

Common terms used to indicate paid partnerships include #ad, #paidpartnership, and #sponsored. 

According to the Finnish Consumer Agency, a simple hashtag is often not enough to alert consumers that the post is sponsored, and influencers must ensure that the disclosure is clear and conspicuous. 

If an influencer fails to properly disclose a paid partnership, they risk being fined by the Consumer Ombudsman.

## ‚ùó Best Practices for Influencer Marketing in Finland

While Finland has been a leader in influencer marketing practices, brands looking to capitalize on this market should still follow some basic best practices when working with influencers in Finland.

### 1. Ensure Proper Disclosure

As we just pointed out, influencers in Finland are required by law to disclose any paid partnerships or advertising. 

This means that brands must ensure that their influencers are following the laws and guidelines set forth by the Finnish Consumer Agency. 

Brands should make it clear to influencers what is required of them in terms of disclosure and should follow up to ensure that they are complying.

### 2. Work with an Influencer Marketing Platform

One of the best ways for brands to ensure success in their influencer marketing campaigns in Finland is to work with an influencer marketing platform. 

Platforms like BaoLiba provide brands with access to top-tier influencers from across Finland, as well as the tools and resources needed to ensure a successful campaign. 

By working with an influencer marketing platform, brands can save time and money, while also increasing their chances of success in their influencer marketing campaigns.

### 3. Focus on Engagement Over Followers

While influencer pricing in Finland is relatively low, brands should still be careful to choose influencers who have high engagement rates. 

While it can be tempting to go for influencers with the highest follower counts, this can often lead to disappointment. 

Many influencers have inflated their follower counts through the use of bots and paid followers. 

By focusing on influencers with high engagement rates, brands can be sure that they are getting their money's worth and that their message will reach real people.

### 4. Avoid Influencers with Fake Followers

In addition to focusing on engagement rates, brands should also try to avoid influencers with fake followers. 

As mentioned earlier, many influencers have inflated their follower counts through the use of bots and paid followers. 

By avoiding influencers with fake followers, brands can ensure that their message reaches real people and that they are getting their money's worth.

### 5. Track Your Campaigns

Finally, it is important for brands to track their influencer marketing campaigns in Finland. 

By tracking campaigns, brands can see what is working and what is not, allowing them to make necessary adjustments and improvements. 

Tracking will also allow brands to measure the success of their campaigns and determine the return on investment.
