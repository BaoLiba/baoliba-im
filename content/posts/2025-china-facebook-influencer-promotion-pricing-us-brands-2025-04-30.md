Chinese Facebook influencers are some of the most effective at swaying purchase decisions. They can be found on the platform, which is often referred to as "Meta" in the West. Facebook is banned in China, meaning all influencers must use VPNs to access it. This has created a massive gap in expertise when it comes to pricing.  

Many US companies planning to enter the Chinese market assume they can pay what they would pay a Chinese Facebook influencer for a campaign, but they often learn the hard way that they must pay much more to persuade a Chinese influencer to promote their brand.  

Here's the breakdown of what US brands can expect to spend on Facebook influencer promotions in China in 2025.

## üì¢ What US Brands Can Expect to Pay in 2025 for Facebook Influencer Promotions in China

The price that US brands can expect to pay for Facebook influencer promotions in China in 2025 will depend on the influencer's audience size and engagement level.  

For example, a smaller Chinese Facebook influencer with an audience of 1,000-10,000 followers may charge between $200 and $500 for a promotional post. A medium-sized influencer with an audience of 10,000-50,000 followers may charge between $500 and $1,500. A larger influencer with an audience of over 50,000 followers may charge as little as $1,500, but most will charge between $3,000 and $10,000 or more.  

The table below summarizes the average fees that Chinese Facebook influencers typically charge for promotional posts and videos.  

| **Audience Size** | **Fee Range per Post** | **Fee Range per Video** |
|--------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| 1,000-10,000       | $200-$500             | $300-$700               |
| 10,000-50,000      | $500-$1,500           | $1,000-$2,500           |
| 50,000+            | $1,500-$10,000+       | $2,500-$20,000+         |  

## üìä The Importance of Followers and Engagement

While the influencer's audience size is an important factor in determining pricing, engagement level is also key. An influencer with a smaller audience of highly engaged followers can command a higher price than one with a larger but less engaged audience.  

For example, a Chinese Facebook influencer with 20,000 followers but a 5% engagement rate will typically charge more than an influencer with 50,000 followers and only a 1% engagement rate.  

This means that brands should not only consider follower count when evaluating Chinese Facebook influencers but also engagement metrics such as likes, comments, shares, and click-through rates.  

## ‚ùó But Exposure Isn't Everything

While it is essential for brands to consider follower count and engagement rates, it is equally important to evaluate the influencer's niche, audience demographics, and overall fit with the brand.  

For example, a Chinese Facebook influencer who specializes in beauty products may not be a good fit for a tech brand, even if they have a large following and high engagement rates.  

Brands should carefully vet influencers to ensure that their content aligns with the brand's values and messaging. This includes reviewing their past promotions, audience feedback, and overall reputation within the industry.  

## üì¢ Average Pricing for Different Types of Promotions by Chinese Facebook Influencers

The type of promotion that a Chinese Facebook influencer does will also impact pricing. A sponsored post or video will typically cost less than a full-fledged campaign that includes multiple posts, videos, stories, and even live streams.  

Here is a breakdown of the average pricing for different types of promotions by Chinese Facebook influencers in 2025:  

| **Promotion Type**        | **Average Fee** |
|---------------------------|-----------------|
| Sponsored Post             | $400            |
| Sponsored Video            | $1,200          |
| Sponsored Story            | $250            |
| Sponsored Live Stream      | $3,000          |
| Full Campaign (5 Posts)   | $5,000          |  

## üìä The Comparison of Pricing Between Different Types of Facebook Promotions by Chinese Influencers in 2025

While the table above shows that the average fee for a sponsored video is higher than that of a sponsored post, it's essential to consider that videos often have a higher engagement rate than posts. Additionally, videos allow for more creativity and storytelling, making them more appealing to audiences.  

The table below compares the average pricing of different types of promotions by Chinese Facebook influencers along with their average engagement rates.  

| **Promotion Type**        | **Average Fee** | **Average Engagement Rate** |
|---------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------|
| Sponsored Post             | $400            | 3%                           |
| Sponsored Video            | $1,200          | 6.5%                         |
| Sponsored Story            | $250            | 2%                           |
| Sponsored Live Stream      | $3,000          | 10%                          |
| Full Campaign (5 Posts)   | $5,000          | 4%                           |  

As you can see, sponsored videos and live streams have higher engagement rates, which can drive better results for brands, making them worth the investment.  

## üì¢ Pricing for Micro and Nano Influencers

While the prices mentioned above are the averages for most Chinese Facebook influencers, brands should also consider working with micro and nano influencers.  

Micro influencers typically have between 1,000 and 100,000 followers, while nano influencers have fewer than 1,000 followers. They often have higher engagement rates and build more authentic connections with their followers, which can lead to better ROI for brands.  

Here is an overview of the average pricing for micro and nano influencers.  

| **Influencer Type**       | **Audience Size**  | **Fee per Post** |
|---------------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Nano Influencer           | 1-1,000           | $100-$300        |
| Micro Influencer          | 1,000-100,000     | $300-$2,000      |

As you can see, brands can save a significant amount of money by working with micro and nano influencers.  

## üìä The Value of Micro and Nano Influencers for Marketing

Although larger influencers may have more followers, many brands find that micro and nano influencers provide better value for their marketing budgets.  

The table below illustrates the average number of followers, engagement rates, and ROI for nano, micro, and macro influencers.  

| **Influencer Type**       | **Average Followers** | **Average Engagement Rate** | **Average ROI** |
|---------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------|------------------|
| Nano Influencer           | 1-1,000               | 5-10%                        | 10x              |
| Micro Influencer          | 1,000-100,000         | 2-5%                         | 6x               |
| Macro Influencer          | 100,000+              | 1-2%                         | 4x               |

As you can see, nano and micro influencers often provide better results for brands, which is why they should be prioritized in influencer marketing strategies.
