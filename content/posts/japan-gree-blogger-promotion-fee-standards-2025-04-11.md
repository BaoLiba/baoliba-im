When you think of Japanese influencers, the image that pops into your head is likely that of a pristine-looking, Kawaii, TikTok teen munching on Japanese snacks, or perhaps an Instagram model wearing trendy, revealing Kfashion on the streets of Shibuya. There‚Äôs not much space in the influencer sphere for everyday Japanese people to appear, but in actuality, KOLs in Japan look much like the people you would encounter in your daily life.  

Japanese influencers can be divided into several categories based on different criteria, but each influencer‚Äôs particular niche may not actually determine their effective reach. There are around 30 million influencers in Japan, and with the market becoming more saturated, people are much more discerning when following their favorite content creators. 

Gree influencers and other niche KOLs have begun to gain traction among Japanese brands, leading to a rise in demand for their services. However, many foreign companies looking to reach the Japanese market may not know exactly how much they should budget for a Gree influencer campaign. If that sounds like you, you‚Äôve come to the right place, because we‚Äôre about to break it all down.


## üìä What is considered a Gree influencer?

Gree influencers are KOLs who post on Gree, one of Japan‚Äôs most popular social media websites. Gree was initially a gaming platform and gained notoriety for its unique takes on multiplayer social games, but it has since evolved into a general social media site. Users can create free accounts through which they can share photos, blogs, and videos with their followers. 

The general classification of influencers is based on the number of followers they possess, but in Japan specifically, this delineation is less relevant. Traditional categories such as nano, micro, macro, and mega influencers aren‚Äôt as important as Japanese companies are much more concerned with evaluating the real engagement an influencer can offer. Brands realize that even an influencer with a handful of followers may have more sway with their audience than an influencer with millions of followers. 

For businesses that may not know the local lingo, it‚Äôs important that they understand how Japanese brands refer to different types of influencers. ‚ÄúInstagrammers‚Äù or ‚ÄúYouTubers,‚Äù for example, refer to influencers on Instagram or YouTube respectively, just as ‚ÄúGree users‚Äù refer to any content creator who is active on Gree. 

To be clear, there isn‚Äôt an established standard for how many followers a Gree influencer must have, but the range varies widely, from those with a but a few dozen to those who boast more than 20 million. 


## ü§ë Gree influencer collaboration pricing

The cost of a Gree influencer partnership is heavily dependent on the influencer‚Äôs overall reach, but even more price variances can occur based on their engagement level, audience demographics, and niche. 

A recent survey indicates that Japanese influencers with 10K-100K followers can charge anywhere from USD 750 to USD 4,000 for a comprehensive marketing package. However, the price of hiring these KOLs for collaborations may fluctuate based on the specific services the influencer is providing and the company‚Äôs needs. 

For example, an influencer may charge **USD 750** to post a single tweet mentioning the brand or product, while the price for creating a product unboxing video for Instagram can reach ***USD 2000***.   

But as we mentioned, follower numbers may not accurately represent an influencer‚Äôs actual engagement rate, so brands may choose to partner with an influencer in a lower tier. 

### Gree influencer package pricing 

| Follower count| Services | Pricing |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1K-20K|  Single post text mentions | USD 50-100 |
| 20K-50K |  Single post image or video mentions | USD 250-500 |
| 50K-100K|  Single post text image mention + pixel link | USD 750-1000 |
| 100K-500K |  Product unboxing video or review | USD 1500-2000 |
| 200K-1M |  Long term ambassador or sponsorship programs | USD 2000-4000 |


## üìà The advantages of Gree influencer advertising

Rather than exorbitant prices, influencers‚Äô pricing packages are more influenced by other factors, such as how authentic they can be with their messaging. Their audience experiences that authenticity in their interactions with the influencer‚Äôs content, which makes them more likely to buy into the influencer‚Äôs endorsements. 

The authenticity of KOLs leads to increased customer engagement and greater conversion rates, which translate to higher ROI for the investments brands make in influencer campaigns. 

Moreover, Japanese consumers trust influencers more than they do traditional marketing channels. This is why brands are pivoting their marketing strategies to include Gree influencer advertising campaigns rather than relying solely on conventional promotional practices. 

### Gree influencers drive conversions

In this way, Gree influencers are actually much more important in the Japanese advertising landscape than their follower counts may suggest. Japanese consumers prioritize experience over actual product or service attributes, which is why they are more likely to trust their peers rather than brands themselves. 

Furthermore, studies show that influencer marketing has become the most effective way for Japanese brands to communicate with their consumers. According to a recent survey, 68.2% of CMOs reported that influencer campaigns resulted in greater customer engagement, while 63.6% said it produced increased sales.

As mentioned earlier, the social media landscape of Japan is heavily saturated, so brands have to be more strategic in targeting their desired consumers. The authenticity that consumers expect from influencers that they follow means that brands should consider hiring multiple influencers to promote their messages. 

### Influencer marketing campaigns require greater planning

But the rising complexity of social media advertising campaigns has made it even more difficult for brands to manage their own influencer marketing campaigns. This is why influencer agencies are becoming so much more valuable in today‚Äôs marketing landscape. 

A campaign can involve dozens of different influencers across multiple different social media platforms, which means that there are many people to coordinate and budgets to monitor. 

Agencies simplify the entire process by acting as a middleman, thus allowing brands to reap the many benefits of influencer partnerships. Some of the most prominent influencer marketing agencies in Japan include Creators‚Äô Next, Otozuki, and VAZ.

Now that we‚Äôve broken down what brands can expect when collaborating with Gree influencers, let‚Äôs also consider what influencers expect from brands in terms of payment methods. 


## üíµ Gree influencer payment methods

Gree influencers prefer working with agencies, as doing so frees them from having to deal directly with brands. Influencer agencies such as Creators‚Äô Next pay KOLs on behalf of brands, which means that influencers can get paid much quicker than if they had to go through the client. 

Gree influencers also have certain expectations about how they get paid. Payment via bank transfer is standard in Japan, but many influencers do not have a bank account that can accept foreign remittances. 

For this reason, brands should coordinate with their chosen influencer or agency to determine the best payment method. 

### Preferred payment methods for Japanese influencers

| Payment Method| Description | Popularity |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Bank Transfer | Default for businesses in Japan | 40% |
| PayPal | Common online payment service | 30% |
| Cryptocurrency | Decentralized digital currency | 20% |
| Gift Cards | Prepaid credit card alternatives | 10% |


## üì¢ How to find Gree influencers

When looking for Gree influencers to collaborate with, brands should start with social media platforms. Although it may seem intuitive, some brands may overlook the very platform they want to advertise on. 

### Gree influencer databases

Gree has a built-in search engine designed to help brands and users connect with one another, so by searching terms that are relevant to their brands, companies can find users who post similar content and contact them for partnership opportunities. 

Influencer databases can also help brands find their next KOL partner. These databases compile lists of influencers from multiple platforms, allowing brands to search by niche, follower numbers, and more. 

Some popular influencer databases in Japan include Honnari, Remote Crew, and PR Table. 


## ‚ùó Choosing the right Gree influencer

Whether brands decide to partner with Gree influencers directly or through agencies, they have to be discerning about whom they choose to work with. Without a careful vetting process, brands risk associating with influencers who can negatively impact their own brand image.

Ultimately, brands should look at an influencer‚Äôs overall E-E-A-T rating. E-E-A-T is a term that refers to the experience, expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness of a particular person or brand. 

A company can hold a Zoom call with the influencer to gauge their personality and how they communicate. They can take a close look at the influencer‚Äôs past collaborations, comments, reviews, and testimonials to see what people are saying about them. 

### Avoid influencer scams

Influencer scams are becoming all too common in the influencer marketing world, which is another reason why brands should work with agencies. 

These scams often involve influencers who promise to deliver a certain type and quality of content for a fee, but when it comes time for them to deliver, they either provide subpar content or no content at all. 

Establishing an influencer vetting process is essential for brands to avoid these scams. 
That said, there are many benefits to collaborating with Gree influencers. Not only do they provide brands with a more authentic way to reach their consumers, but they can also deliver better conversions with lower acquisition costs, making them a highly valuable marketing tool.
