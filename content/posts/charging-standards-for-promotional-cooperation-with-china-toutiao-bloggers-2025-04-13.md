When it comes to paid promotions in China, Douyin and Xiaohongshu might not be the only popular platforms out there. 

From 2023 into 2025, Toutiao has made much effort to reshape its image from a news aggregator to an influencer marketing platform. This strategy has led to the emergence of numerous influencers on Toutiao, especially among Chinese-speaking netizens.

Compared with familiar platforms like Douyin, Toutiao has different ways of promotion and influencer collaboration, and its influencers also have different pricing standards.

As a US advertiser looking for Chinese influencer promotion channels, this article will detail the pricing standards of Chinese Toutiao influencers in 2025 based on your familiar logic.

## üì± What Is Toutiao?

Toutiao, known as Jinri Toutiao in Chinese, translates to today's headlines, and is a popular news aggregation app in China. It is owned by the China internet technology company ByteDance, which owns TikTok.

Toutiao's slogan is "a personalized information platform," and it makes use of AI technology to recommend high-quality information tailored to user preferences.

Toutiao has over 200 million daily active users, and over 600 million monthly active users. It is one of the most popular mobile applications in China and continues to rank among the top 10 apps in China.

ByteDance invested heavily in Toutiao influencers, having even opened an influencer marketing agency called Toutiao Miguojing around 2020.

In recent years, the platform has gradually begun to implement revenue-sharing policies to give content creators a larger share of ad revenue. 

## üí∞ Toutiao Influencer Pricing Standards

As of 2025, the pricing standards of Toutiao influencers for paid promotions are, in general, below those of their peers on more popular Chinese influencer marketing platforms like Douyin and Xiaohongshu.

Toutiao influencers' pricing generally starts from a few hundred yuan per promotional post. The average payment is within the range of 1,000 to 2,000 yuan per promotional post, and most of them accept payments from local Chinese companies via WeChat Pay.

The pricing standards of Toutiao influencers show varying pricing models based on video duration, views, and promotions in their other social accounts.

### 1. Pricing Based on Video Duration

As an advertiser, it's crucial to understand that pricing standards among Toutiao influencers vary based on the duration of the promotional video.

A promotional video of one minute in length can average 2,000 yuan, while a 15-second promotional video averages 500 yuan.

For 2025, Toutiao influencer pricing for a promotional video will remain within this range.

### 2. Pricing Based on Video Views

The popularity of a video influencer can be measured by its views. The same goes for Toutiao influencers too, their pricing can vary based on the views of their posts.

As of 2025, Toutiao influencers usually charge 10 to 20 yuan for every 1,000 views on their posts.

That means a promotional post that receives 100,000 views will cost 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, while one post that goes viral and gets 1,000,000 views will cost around 10,000 yuan.

### 3. Pricing of Cross-Account Promotions

Toutiao influencers also collaborate with other social accounts. For example, they may share their Toutiao posts on more popular social platforms, like Xiaohongshu, Douyin, Weibo, and others.

This kind of cross-account sharing can also change pricing standards. 

For example, tens of thousands of yuan are required for popular influencer Xue Xueer to share a post on Xiaohongshu. If she also shares it on her Douyin and Toutiao accounts, that could add another tens of thousands of yuan.

However, a promotion can save time and labor costs for advertisers. If advertisers can afford it, cross-account promotions can be beneficial to them. 

## üìß How to Collaborate with Toutiao Influencers?

Before you contact and collaborate with Toutiao influencers, you need to know some registration procedures.

### 1. Register an Account

To contact influencers and collaborate with them on Toutiao, you must first have a registered account on Toutiao. Your registered account must also be a company account affiliated with a Chinese identification number or registration number.

### 2. Contact Toutiao Influencers

The easiest way to contact Toutiao influencers for collaboration is through a trusted Chinese influencer marketing platform like BaoLiba, which specializes in overseas influencer marketing.

### 3. Pay with WeChat

For advertisers, the payment method for collaborating with Toutiao influencers is also crucial. Currently, the only payment option is WeChat Pay, a popular payment method for most Chinese, even for Baidu, another internet giant owned by Baidu, Inc.

Foreign advertisers need to apply for a company WeChat account and link a Chinese bank account to their WeChat Pay so they can process payments via WeChat.

## üéØ Conclusion

In summary, from 2023 to 2025, the pricing standards of Toutiao influencers for promotional posts remain at a few hundred yuan minimum.

The average pricing of several thousand yuan for promotional posts remains below that of other Chinese influencer marketing platforms.

This makes Toutiao an opportunity for US advertisers looking to collaborate with Chinese influencers but with a limited budget.
