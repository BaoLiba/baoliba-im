## 📈 Influencers are becoming more expensive in Denmark

In Denmark, the pricing of influencer collaborations is based on various factors. According to a study from 2023, the prices depend on the influencer's follower count and engagement rate, as well as the type of project, the platform, and the influencer's niche. 

As the influencer marketing industry matures in Denmark, influencers have been able to charge higher prices for their services. In 2025, influencer prices will become more transparent, making it easier for brands to compare costs and budgets.

The following is an overview of the average price range for sponsored posts on Instagram in Denmark in 2025, differentiated by followers.


### 📊 Estimated Instagram influencer pricing in Denmark in 2025

| Followers          | Price (USD)        |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| 1,000             | 40                  |
| 5,000             | 160                 |
| 10,000            | 330                 |
| 25,000            | 640                 |
| 50,000            | 1,330               |
| 100,000           | 1,800               |

According to the influencer marketing platform, BaoLiba, the average price for an Instagram post in Denmark is around USD 1,500.

The table above highlights that influencers in Denmark with fewer followers tend to have a higher cost per post. For example, an influencer with 1,000 followers would charge USD 40 per post, resulting in a cost of USD 40 per 1,000 followers. Conversely, influencers with 1 million followers would charge USD 10,000 per post, equating to only USD 10 per 1,000 followers.

Influencers with fewer followers often have niche audiences and higher engagement rates, which allows them to charge more for their posts. The emerging trend is that various existing pricing models will be replaced by a more unified system that applies to influencers across all platforms.

When collaborating with influencers, brands can choose from various types of posts. Each post type has its own unique advantages and caters to different marketing objectives.

### 📣 How do Instagram influencers in Denmark get paid? 

Danish influencers typically receive payment for their marketing activities through bank transfers. Following a successful campaign, the influencer will share their payment details, including their bank name, account name, and account number, with the brand. 

The brand then initiates a wire transfer to the influencer's bank account to complete the payment process. Although some influencers may accept alternative payment methods, such as PayPal, the majority prefer bank transfers due to their security and reliability.

According to a 2023 survey, 42% of influencers in Denmark stated that they would not work with brands that do not offer bank transfers as a payment option. This indicates that for brands looking to collaborate with influencers in Denmark, facilitating bank transfer payments is essential for successful partnerships.


### 🚧 How does the law affect influencer marketing in Denmark?

In Denmark, advertising regulations dictate that influencers must disclose when they have been compensated for promoting products or services.

The Danish Consumer Ombudsman has established several guidelines for advertising disclosures by influencers. The following are key points from the guidelines that influencers should adhere to:


1. The disclosure must be placed at the top of the post to ensure it is immediately visible to consumers.
2. The disclosure should use clear and understandable terms that indicate the content is an advertisement.
3. Abbreviations such as "ad," "adv," or "sponsored" are acceptable, but should be made clear that they pertain to advertising. For example, the term "ad" should not be buried in a long list of hashtags.
4. The use of emojis, such as "cash" or "money bag," is prohibited for disclosing advertising.
