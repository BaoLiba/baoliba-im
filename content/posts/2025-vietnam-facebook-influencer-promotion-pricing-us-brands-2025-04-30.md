## üìà Why Facebook Is Best for Influencer Marketing in Vietnam
In Vietnam, Facebook is the most popular social media platform, with 83% of respondents preferring it over TikTok, Instagram, and Zalo. The average user spends an astounding 2 hours and 45 minutes per day on the platform.

According to a recent survey of 1,000 Vietnamese users conducted by WeAreSocial, Facebook is also the most trusted social media platform for product recommendations. 

This makes it the ideal channel for influencer marketing, where creators build trust and authority with their followers through engaging content.

### üåé Penetration Across Vietnam
In Southeast Asia, Vietnam has the highest percentage of Facebook users. Approximately 75% of Vietnamese internet users aged 16 to 64 are on Facebook, compared to 71% in Thailand, 66% in Malaysia, and 64% in Singapore.

Young Vietnamese consumers are especially keen on the platform. Nearly 90% of internet users aged 16-24 and 81% of those aged 25-34 have Facebook accounts.

### üì£ Facebook Is the Best for Recommendations
In Vietnam, Facebook is rated the best social media platform for recommendations, with 63% of respondents preferring it over TikTok (57%), Instagram (46%), and Zalo (42%).

## üéØ Local Practices for Working with Vietnamese Influencers
If you are considering influencer marketing in Vietnam, you need to be aware of local practices in order to find the right influencers and avoid scams. 

### üìù Contracts Are a Must
When hiring a Facebook influencer in Vietnam, it is essential to have a contract. This protects both you and the influencer in case of misunderstandings. Contracts should outline duties, expectations, payment terms, and delivery deadlines.

While contracts are not strictly enforced in Vietnam, they are a sign of professionalism and seriousness. If an influencer refuses to sign, look elsewhere.

### ü§ù Pay in Installments
Most Vietnamese influencers will ask for payment in installments. A common arrangement is a 50% upfront deposit, followed by the remaining 50% upon delivery of the promotional post.

If an influencer insists on full payment upfront, consider this a red flag and proceed with caution.

### üíª Use an Agency
Given that influencer marketing is a relatively new industry in Vietnam, many influencers lack business acumen and marketing experience. They may not understand pricing standards or what marketing deliverables you expect. 

Using an agency to connect with influencers can save you time and headaches. An agency will already know reputable influencers within your budget, and they can negotiate prices on your behalf. 

Be sure to verify that the agency itself is reputable. Some agencies are just as shady as the influencers.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Beware of Scams
While the vast majority of Vietnamese influencers are honest professionals, some are scammers looking to take advantage of foreign brands. 

### ‚ùó Pay Attention to Followers
Some influencers artificially inflate their follower count, making them appear more popular than they really are. If an influencer has tens of thousands of followers but very few likes or comments on their posts, this may indicate that they have purchased followers.

### üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Look for Engagement
Even if an influencer has a realistic follower count, you still need to check engagement. If their posts have very few likes or comments, they may not have an authentic audience. 

Also, pay attention to the comments. If they are all generic comments like ‚Äúgreat post‚Äù or ‚Äúlove it,‚Äù this may indicate that the influencer is using bots to boost engagement.

### üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Check for Real Followers
Also, check the profiles of the influencer‚Äôs followers and likes. If they are mostly fake accounts with no profile pictures or posts, that‚Äôs another sign that the influencer is deceiving you.

### üé• Verify Deliverables
To avoid scams, only pay the second half of the influencer‚Äôs fee after you have received their deliverables. You should have the promotional post in hand before sending the remaining payment. 

If an influencer refuses to share the post link before payment, look for another influencer.

## üîç How to Find Facebook Influencers in Vietnam
Finding Facebook influencers in Vietnam is no different from finding them anywhere else in the world. You can search manually or use an influencer marketing platform.

### üîó Search Manually
You can find Facebook influencers in Vietnam by searching relevant hashtags. For example, if you have a fashion brand, try searching hashtags like #fashionblogger #fashionista #ootd #fashionstyle.

In Vietnam, hashtags are often written in Vietnamese, so you should also search hashtags like #th·ªùi_trang and #th·ªùi_trang_n·ªØ.

### üì± Use an Influencer Platform
Using an influencer marketing platform is often the easiest and fastest way to find influencers. You can filter by audience demographics, engagement metrics, and pricing.

If you want to work with Facebook influencers in Vietnam, look for a platform that connects brands with creators on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and other channels.

## üìù Conclusion
Vietnamese Facebook influencers are among the best in the world at creating engaging content and converting followers into customers. With prices as low as $100, they offer incredible value for brands looking to tap into Vietnam‚Äôs massive consumer market.

But as with any influencer marketing campaign, it‚Äôs important to do your homework and ensure that you are getting what you pay for. 

Using an influencer marketing platform can save you time and headaches, allowing you to focus on what you do best.
