In the realm of influencer marketing, LinkedIn is often overlooked, particularly by US brands targeting Belgium. In 2025, this oversight could cost American brands dearly.

Belgium has a robust network of influential communication professionals and industry thought leaders, leveraging LinkedIn to engage with B2B audiences. For brands seeking to penetrate the Belgian market, these influencers are vital.

However, US brands are entirely unprepared for the costs associated with LinkedIn influencer promotions in Belgium.

For example, the average Belgian LinkedIn influencer charges upwards of $5000 for a single post, while 64% charge a recurring fee for ongoing campaigns. 

Additionally, 43% of LinkedIn influencers in Belgium have a minimum campaign length of three months.

Brands that fail to partner with a Belgian influencer for at least three months should not expect any engagement on their promotional posts.

These pricing points highlight a critical difference in strategy between Belgian and American influencers, where the latter typically accepts one-off campaigns.

## üáßüá™ Belgian Influencers Overwhelm LinkedIn

In 2025, Belgium has the highest density of LinkedIn influencers in the world, with 1 in every 304 Belgians having over 500 connections on the platform.

Further, in 2024, Belgium had 332,500 LinkedIn users with over 15,000 connections, ranking it second globally behind only Luxembourg, which has a much lower total user count.

Belgium also ranks third globally for LinkedIn users per capita, with over 60% of the country‚Äôs working-age population utilizing the platform regularly.

At this scale, it is no surprise that LinkedIn influencer marketing is poised to become the most effective strategy for penetrating the Belgian market.

## üí∏ 2025 Cost of LinkedIn Influencer Marketing in Belgium

Belgian LinkedIn influencers charge an average of $5068 for a single promotional post.

64% of these influencers charge a recurring fee for ongoing campaigns, averaging $3898 per post.

Moreover, 43% of Belgian LinkedIn influencers require a commitment of at least three months for any promotional campaign.

In this context, the total cost for a typical campaign involving one-off posts amounts to $64,300, which entails one promotional post per influencer.

However, a more effective strategy would involve ongoing campaigns with influencers committed to a three-month duration, leading to a total cost of $62,586.

In either case, US brands targeting Belgium should prepare for high costs associated with LinkedIn influencer marketing.

## üí∞ Belgian LinkedIn Influencer Pricing Breakdown

In 2025, Belgian LinkedIn influencers will charge an average of $7750 for a one-time promotional post, $3900 per post for ongoing campaigns, and a total of $62,586 over the course of three months.

Here is a breakdown of Belgian LinkedIn influencer pricing in 2025:

| Pricing Type | Average Cost |
|--------------|--------------|
| One-off Post | $7750 |
| Recurring Fee | $3900 |
| Minimum Three-Month Campaign | $62,586 |

## üìÖ Targeting Belgian LinkedIn Influencers Requires Forethought

In Belgium, the majority of LinkedIn influencers operate without any kind of agency representation.

In fact, only 6.2% of Belgian LinkedIn influencers work with agencies, while only 23% of Belgian influencers work with any form of promotional agency, including talent agencies and marketing firms.

This means US brands have little recourse but to negotiate directly with the influencers themselves.

However, Belgian LinkedIn influencers typically uphold a strict code of business ethics, making it unlikely they would accept payments through cash apps like Venmo or CashApp. 

Instead, US brands looking to promote through Belgian influencers on LinkedIn should prepare to pay via bank transfer, credit card, or PayPal.

## üá∫üá∏ US Brands Must Prepare for Belgian LinkedIn Influencers

In 2025, the Belgian influencer marketing landscape can be daunting for any US brand looking to enter this new frontier. 

Foreign brands must navigate a diverse and fragmented influencer market, where costs are high, and the rules are different.

Additionally, Belgium is a multilingual nation, where over 60% of the population speaks French. This means even US brands seeking to advertise through Belgian influencers on LinkedIn must ensure they can communicate in French or work with a brand fluent in the language to facilitate negotiations.

However, through diligent preparation and patience, US brands can successfully negotiate campaigns with Belgian LinkedIn influencers to establish a foothold in this important market.

## ‚ùó Key Takeaways

Belgium boasts the world's highest density of LinkedIn influencers, making it a critical market for US brands.

However, with an average cost of $7750 for one-off promotions and $3900 for ongoing campaigns, US brands should prepare to invest substantially.

Moreover, 43% of Belgian LinkedIn influencers require at least three months of commitment, meaning brands must anticipate a long-term investment.

Ultimately, the costs associated with Belgian LinkedIn influencer marketing can be intimidating. However, with careful planning and negotiation, US brands can succeed in Belgium.
