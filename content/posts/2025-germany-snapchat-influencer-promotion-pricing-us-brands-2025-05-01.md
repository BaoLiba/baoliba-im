This is one of the biggest mistakes that US brands make when hiring German Snapchat influencers. 

They do not conduct thorough research to determine the most suitable influencers for their brand. 

Here are some important factors that you should consider when researching German Snapchat influencers for your brand promotions:

- **Niche**: Make sure that the influencer's niche aligns with your brand. For example, if you sell beauty products, look for beauty influencers.
