Snapchat influencer marketing is a powerful way for US brands to reach the youth market in Malaysia. The platform is one of the most popular social media sites in the country, especially among young people.

In fact, approximately 77% of Malaysian users are below 34 years old, making it imperative for US brands looking to reach younger audiences to leverage Snapchat influencers in Malaysia.

But how much do Snapchat influencers in Malaysia charge? In this article, we break down the latest pricing insights for US brands planning to run influencer marketing campaigns on Snapchat in Malaysia in 2025.


## üí∞ Malaysia Snapchat Influencer Pricing for US Brands in 2025

The average cost of hiring top-tier Snapchat influencers in Malaysia for a sponsored post is estimated to be between $500 to $800. 

But some well-known influencers can charge USD $1,200 or more for a single sponsored post.


## üìà Factors That Affect the Pricing of Snapchat Influencers in Malaysia

Several factors affect the rates that Malaysian Snapchat influencers charge for their promotional services. The following are a few of these factors:

### 1. üèÜ Influencer Tier

In Malaysia, Snapchat influencers are categorized into three main tiers based on their follower count and influence. These tiers can affect the pricing of promotional posts.

- **Macro-Influencers**: Macro-influencers in Malaysia have between 100,000 to 1 million followers. They usually charge between $800 and $1,200 for a single sponsored Snapchat post.
  
- **Micro-Influencers**: Micro-influencers have between 10,000 and 100,000 followers. They are more relatable than macro-influencers, and they usually charge between $200 to $800 for a single sponsored Snapchat post.
  
- **Nano-Influencers**: Nano-influencers have less than 10,000 followers. They are often considered the most relatable and trustworthy type of influencer, which can be beneficial for brands that are looking for authenticity. Their rates are usually between $50 to $200 for a single sponsored Snapchat post.


### 2. üìÖ Length of Promotion

The length of the promotion can also affect the pricing of sponsored Snapchat posts in Malaysia. For example:

- **One-Time Promotion**: A one-time promotion, which is a single sponsored post, will cost less than a long-term promotion. One-time promotions usually cost between $50 to $1,200, depending on the influencer tier and follower count.

- **Long-Term Promotion**: Long-term promotions, where influencers create regular content for a specified time, can cost significantly more. For instance, a long-term promotion can cost between $1,500 to $3,000 for a contract that spans over six months.


### 3. üíº Campaign Requirements

The requirements of the campaign can also affect the overall pricing of Snapchat influencer promotions in Malaysia.

- **Number of Posts**: The number of posts that the influencer is required to create can affect the pricing of the promotion. For example, an influencer may charge $200 for a single post but may charge $500 for two posts.

- **Content Type**: The type of content that the influencer is required to create can also affect the pricing. For example, an influencer may charge more for a video post than for a photo post.

- **Editing & Production**: If the influencer is required to do additional editing or production work, this may also increase the cost of the promotion.


### 4. üéØ Influencer Niche

The niche that the influencer specializes in can also affect the pricing of their promotional services. Some niches are more competitive than others, which can drive up prices. 

For example, beauty and fashion influencers tend to charge more than lifestyle influencers because of the competitive nature of the beauty niche. 

### 5. üåé Geographic Market

The geographic market of the influencer‚Äôs audience can also affect the pricing of their promotional services. Influencers whose audiences are primarily from high-income countries tend to charge more than those whose audiences are primarily from low-income countries.

For example, a Snapchat influencer in Malaysia whose audience consists mainly of US citizens will likely charge more than one whose audience consists primarily of Malaysian citizens.
