Finding the right influencer for your brand is a tough gig, especially when you‚Äôre doing it from the other side of the world. The nuances of social media marketing and the cultural context that comes with them can make or break your campaign. 

If you‚Äôre looking to expand your brand‚Äôs reach in India, TikTok is a great place to start, and you‚Äôll want to hire Indian influencers. 

But how much will it cost you to work with TikTok influencers in India?  

We‚Äôll take a look at what you can expect to pay to work with Indian TikTok influencers in 2025, and why it‚Äôs worth every penny.

## üìä The Market for TikTok Influencer Marketing in India is Massive

Part of the reason why TikTok is so popular in India is that it‚Äôs the best way for local brands to connect with their target market. TikTok has a higher penetration rate in India than in many Western countries, making it one of the most effective marketing platforms for reaching Indian consumers.

Over 67% of Indian TikTok users have watched promotional content on the platform.

India is already TikTok‚Äôs largest market, with 300 million users as of 2023. By 2025, that number is expected to grow to nearly 500 million users. This means that brands, both local and foreign, have a huge opportunity to tap into TikTok influencer marketing.

And in India, it‚Äôs a no-brainer that your TikTok influencer marketing campaigns should be your priority. 

The app has taken over the market, and TikTok influencers are seen as trusted experts. According to a 2023 survey, 72% of Indian TikTok users trust influencers more than celebrities.  

In fact, Indian TikTok influencers are able to generate a higher ROI than influencer marketing campaigns run on other social media platforms. 

If you‚Äôre serious about your brand‚Äôs marketing efforts in India, you need to prioritize TikTok influencer marketing.  

## üí∞ How Much Do TikTok Influencers in India Cost? 

As is the case with most influencer marketing, you can expect to pay more for the influencers with larger followings. 

For most TikTok influencers in India, you can expect to pay anywhere from $50 to $6000 per post. 

Here is a breakdown of what you can expect to pay for different tiers of TikTok influencers in India in 2025:

| Tier | Number of Followers | Cost Range Per Post |
| ---- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Micro-Influencer | 1k - 100k | $50 - $600 |
| Mid-Tier Influencer | 100k - 1M | $600 - $3000 |
| Mega Influencer | 1M - 10M | $3000 - $6000 |
| Celebrity Influencer | 10M+ | $6000+ |

### ü§≥ Micro-Influencers are Just as Effective

While there‚Äôs a lot of hype surrounding mega TikTok influencers, don‚Äôt overlook micro-influencers. In fact, in the Indian market, micro-influencers often outperform mega influencers when it comes to generating sales.

In 2025, you can expect to only pay around $50 to $600 per post for an Indian TikTok influencer with under 100k followers. 

While they have a smaller audience, micro-influencers often have more loyal followings and higher engagement rates than their mega counterparts. 

This is especially true in India. As of 2023, micro-influencers in India had engagement rates of 6.1%, while mega influencers had engagement rates of only 1.0%. 

Micro-influencers are able to build more meaningful connections with their audience. This means they‚Äôre much better at convincing their audience to take action, such as trying your product.

### üìà TikTok Influencer Marketing ROI Is High

Most brands see a high return on investment when it comes to TikTok influencer marketing. In fact, a 2023 survey found that 56% of brands that have invested in TikTok influencer marketing report a better ROI than other social media platforms.  

When it comes to TikTok influencers in India, you can expect even higher returns. According to a study conducted by the influencer agency, BrandzUp, 75% of Indian brands who invested in TikTok influencer marketing reported a higher ROI compared to other social media platforms. 

## ‚úÖ Why You Should Invest in TikTok Influencers in India

As of 2023, India has 300 million TikTok users, making it the app‚Äôs largest market. By 2025, that number is expected to hit 500 million. 

With more people turning to TikTok for entertainment and news, and its penetration rates getting higher in India, marketing on the app will be critical for brands that want to reach Indian consumers.

In fact, a recent study revealed that 67% of Indian consumers are interested in buying a product after seeing it promoted by a TikTok influencer.

Furthermore, TikTok influencers in India are able to generate higher engagement rates than other influencers. According to Statista, as of January 2023, the average engagement rate of Indian TikTok influencers was 9.6%. 

That‚Äôs nearly double the average engagement rate of Instagram influencers in India, which was only 4.6%. 

## ‚ùó How to Choose the Right TikTok Influencers in India

When looking for TikTok influencers in India, you need to consider their engagement rates. Influencers with more followers often have lower engagement rates, so don‚Äôt be fooled by their follower count.

You want to work with TikTok influencers with a high engagement rate, regardless of their follower count.

In addition to engagement rates, you also need to consider the influencer‚Äôs niche. 

Ensure that their content aligns with your brand‚Äôs image and values. Working with influencers who don‚Äôt align with your brand can hurt your brand‚Äôs reputation and turn off potential customers.
