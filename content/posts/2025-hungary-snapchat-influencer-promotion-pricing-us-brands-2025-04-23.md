As Snapchat emerges as a popular platform for influencers in Hungary, brands from the USA looking for cost-effective marketing strategies can leverage the competitive advantage of pricing when working with influencers from this specific region.

In this article, we will delve into the state of influencer marketing on Snapchat in Hungary and the potential pricing models that are favorable for US brands expecting to launch campaigns in 2025.

## üìä Prevalence of Snapchat in Hungary

According to recent data, Snapchat has begun to steadily rise to become one of the most popular social media platforms in Hungary, especially among youngsters. It currently ranks as the 5th most popular social media platform in the country with over 3 million users.

The share of social media users on Snapchat in Hungary is about 35.7% of the total population, which is about 0.9% higher than the global average of around 34.8%. Statista has forecasted that the number of Snapchat users in Hungary will continue to rise and reach over 3.3 million users by 2025.

## üì¢ The appeal of Snapchat influencers for US brands

One significant benefit of using Snapchat influencers in Hungary to reach out to the local market is the efficiency of the platform. Compared to other social media platforms, Snapchat consistently ranks as one of the top-performing platforms for social media marketing campaigns, boasting strong video engagement and an established base of active users.

Studies have shown that about 74% of users feel they are missing out on something important if they do not check Snapchat at least once a day, and approximately 32% of users check Snapchat more than 10 times a day.

Furthermore, Snapchat holds 82% of the market share of social media users aged 18-24 years old in Hungary, which makes it a great platform for brands targeting this age demographic.

41% of Snapchat users say they prefer to consume video content, compared to only 28% of all social media users. This means brands collaborating with Hungarian influencers on Snapchat is an effective way to reach a wide audience through compelling stories and ads. 

Even more, 65% of users reportedly have watched an influencer's story on Snapchat. This is a promising chance for brands to get valuable exposure through influencer marketing campaigns.

## üí≤ Snap influencer marketing costs in Hungary

The costs of working with Snapchat influencers in Hungary are compelling for US brands that are trying to cut marketing costs while still getting quality results.

Brands can expect to pay around $60 on average to $1200 for top-level influencers per sponsored Snap. This is a fraction of the cost compared to the average price of $800 to $3000 that brands have to pay for Snapchat influencers in the USA.

For bigger campaigns, US brands can hire Instagram influencers who also have Snapchat accounts and promote content on both platforms. The average prices for Snapchat promotion by Instagram influencers from Hungary range from $90 to $1500.

The average price for Snapchat promotions by content creator agencies is around $140 per Snap. In 2025, brand owners will be able to save even more by hiring Snapchat influencers through agencies that promise to beat competitor prices.

### Factors affecting Snapchat influencer pricing in Hungary

Several aspects can affect pricing when brands work with Snapchat influencers in Hungary. Here are some of the factors that brands need to keep in mind when developing their budgets:

1. **Influencer Category**: The category of influencers plays a major role in determining the overall budget for influencer campaigns on Snapchat. Influencers are usually grouped into categories based on their number of followers. In Hungary, brands can expect to pay around $60 to $1200 for a sponsored Snap from influencers in these categories:

    - Nano influencers with 1000-10,000 followers cost roughly $60-$300 per Snap.
    - Micro influencers with 10,000-50,000 followers cost around $300-$600 per Snap
    - Mid-tier influencers with 50,000-500,000 followers cost about $600-$1,200 per Snap.
    - Macro influencers with 500,000+ followers cost approximately $1,200+ per Snap.

2. **Influencer Niche**: Certain niche categories are more marketable than others, which can impact influencer pricing. For example, influencers in the beauty, fitness, or fashion industry can charge higher prices compared to influencers in other categories.

3. **Timeline**: Brands that need quicker results may have to pay more fees to influencers to promote content on Snapchat. This is also true for brands that want mass posted content during a campaign. 

4. **Exclusivity**: The more exclusive the collaboration, the higher the price. Brands that allow influencers to have more creative control over content are also likely to pay more for promotions.

5. **Type of Content**: There are different types of promos that influencers can do on Snapchat. Brands may have to pay more for custom content compared to pre-made content that can be easily shared.

6. **Influencer Location**: Influencers from major urban areas typically charge more than influencers from rural areas. However, influencers from rural areas may still have a higher demand based on the uniqueness of their niche.

7. **Agency Fees**: It is common for influencers to work with agencies that can help promote their content. Brands may also find agencies that help connect them to influencers. In many cases, agencies will charge fees to brands, as well as to influencers, which can increase overall campaign costs. 

## üíº Cost-effective ways to pay Snapchat influencers in Hungary

Unfortunately, not all payment options work for Snapchat influencers in Hungary. US brands must ensure they are paying influencers through payment methods that are popular in Hungary. 

Here are the most favorable payment methods to consider when hiring influencers from Hungary:

The platform has wide coverage in Hungary and has become a very popular way to do business in the country. It is also useful for US brands that have PayPal business accounts, because they can send or receive international payments with no fees.

2. **Wire Transfer**: This is another cost-effective way to send money to influencers in Hungary. However, brands should note that international wire transfers can take several days to finalize. There may also be high fees involved for brands as well as fees on the influencer's end.

3. **TransferWise (Wise)**: Using Wise is one of the cheapest ways to send money internationally to Hungary. It has a low flat fee and a low currency conversion rate. Furthermore, payment is split into two payments which helps brands save lots of money on fees.

4. **Revolut**: This is another great payment option that has gained popularity in Hungary. This app lets users send and receive money without high transaction costs. It is a great app for brands hiring influencers in Hungary.
