Amid the tumult of surging inflation, skyrocketing prices, and slow wage growth, it's easy to dismiss the value delivered by an influencer. 

Anyone who has seen the caps on the Medium pages or accounts can instantly tell that the user has the authority to charge for their posts. 

Vietnam is rapidly augmenting its influencer marketing spends, with Medium influencers at the forefront as they leverage their credibility in the industry to sell their services. 

In Vietnam, the prices quoted by Medium influencers for collaborations can run into the hundreds of dollars.

## üèÜ Medium influencers in Vietnam

As the country experiences an economic boom, Vietnamese influencers are positioning themselves to capture a share of the vast marketing budgets being allocated for influencer marketing. 
 
Vietnam is already a global hub for influencer marketing, with the country‚Äôs people being some of the most prolific users of social media. 
 
Media figures estimate that the number of influencers in the country has more than doubled between 2020 and 2023, with millions of users registered on various social media platforms.

Influencer marketing accounts for an increasing share of the overall advertising spend, and with its power compelling marketers towards its use, this share is expected to only increase. 

Presently, influencer marketing spending is estimated at being at around 1.25 million dollars, with that figure set to increase to over 2 million dollars by 2025.

While the majority of this marketing expenditure goes to other social media platforms, Medium influencers are finding a foothold through their industry authority. 

The Medium influencer marketing rates among Vietnamese are skyrocketing due to the growing pool of available influencers who can be leveraged for advertising purposes. 

#### üìà An example of a Vietnamese Medium influencer

Alisa Lam is a Vietnamese Medium influencer who specializes in tech marketing. 

She has over 12,000 followers on her profile and is reputed for writing quality content, especially in the area of tech product reviews. 

Alisa, like many others, markets her Medium profile as a greenlight for brands to get in touch for advertising opportunities in which she promotes their brands through compelling articles on her Medium page. 

Alisa's advertising fees for posts extolling the benefits of a tech product are estimated to be between 200 and 500 dollars, depending on the prominence of the display of branding elements in the article. 

#### üí∏ How Medium influencer marketing works in Vietnam 

Just like any other advertising campaign, a Medium influencer marketing campaign begins with outreach.

Brands or advertising agencies reach out to the influencer through their social media accounts, or their official emails inquiring about available advertising options. 

Once the influencer responds with available packages and their pricing, the discussions continue until they reach an understanding.

It is common for Vietnamese Medium influencers to ask for a portion of the payment upfront before they begin to create the content. 

The influencers will usually ask for at least half of their fees upfront, with the other half being sent after the content goes live on their Medium account. 

This payment method is common across Vietnam, with influencers preferring to use online payment platforms like Paypal, Stripe, or Venmo to collect payments. 

#### üìä The rates charged by Medium influencers in Vietnam 

Medium influencers in Vietnam charge largely based on the number of followers they have on their pages. 

For users with anywhere from 1,000 to 5,000 followers, they can charge anywhere from 100 to 200 dollars, again depending on the branding prominence accepted by the influencer. 

Medium influencers in Vietnam with more than 5,000 followers typically charge at least 200 dollars for collaboration.

If your brand is trying to break into the Vietnamese market or is already within it, consider partnering with a Medium influencer.

Medium influencers in Vietnam are relatively cheap when compared with other social media influencers, who can charge thousands of dollars for sponsored posts. 

While it‚Äôs common for other social media influencers with large followings to promise to post the content on their pages, they can still ghost or fail to publish the content, leaving marketers with nothing to show for their hard work. 

Medium influencers typically do not ghost on their commitments, and they promise to write quality articles to ensure that their followers keep interacting with their articles regularly.

## üì¢ The influencer marketing landscape in Vietnam

### ‚ùó The challenges of influencer marketing in Vietnam 

However, while influencer marketing is booming in Vietnam, there is a dark side to it that brands need to be aware of. 

As the industry has grown, so have the scams associated with it. 

In Vietnam, influencers will sometimes promise the world but fail to deliver.

They will claim they forgot to hit publish or will block the user altogether. 

As a result, it is vital that brands conducting influencer outreach in Vietnam ensure that they perform due diligence in order to avoid being scammed.

Typically, high-powered influencers will have the following metrics:

- A good number of followers, usually above 5,000. 
- A decent amount of views per article. 
- An average reading time of 3 to 7 minutes per article.
- Endearing comments on their articles from readers.
