Wondering how much Vietnamese Twitch influencers charge for sponsored content? You're not the only one. The murky waters of marketing fees can be tough to navigate for agencies specializing in influencer marketing, especially when it‚Äôs not your home country.

So whether you‚Äôre a potential advertiser or influencer looking to monetize your Twitch streams, our comprehensive guide has the prices you need for 2025.

## üí≤ How Much Vietnamese Twitch Influencers Charge 

Generally speaking, you can expect to pay between $25-$50 for a sponsored shoutout from a Vietnamese Twitch influencer with a small audience. 

In contrast, influencers with a larger audience on the platform can command several hundred to several thousand dollars for promotions, depending on how well-known they are and how engaged their audience is.

### ü§ñ Sponsored Content Examples
In terms of the exact type of sponsored content you can expect, the most common formats include:

- **Live Stream Shoutouts**: A popular choice among Twitch streamers, this heavily integrated format makes promoting your product a piece of cake. Streamers will utilize your product or service while playing a game and offer a shoutout every now and then. You can expect to pay anywhere from $50 to $3,000 per hour, depending on how many viewers tune in to watch the stream. 

- **VOD Sponsorships**: Another option is to sponsor a Video on Demand (VOD) and have your brand mentioned there instead of during a live stream. This type of sponsorship is cheaper and can cost anywhere between $25-$1,500. 

- **Chat Mentions**: Sponsored chat messages cost anywhere between $10-$500 and are a great way to gain initial exposure for your brand. Streamers will display your text ad on the screen during their streams and keep it up for a specified duration. 

- **Product Placement**: If you sell a physical product, think about paying Vietnamese Twitch influencers to showcase it while they stream. Expect to shell out anywhere from $100-$500 for your item to receive a brief showcase. 

### üí∏ Payment Terms

Another thing to keep in mind when working with Vietnamese Twitch influencers is how they prefer to be paid. While US advertisers tend to use PayPal or wire transfers, most Vietnamese influencers prefer to be paid via direct bank transfer so they can quickly access their funds. 

Note that you will likely need to pay a small foreign transaction fee, which is typically around 3% of the total amount.

#### üìà Pricing Factors

The price for influencer collaborations on Twitch can vary greatly depending on a number of factors, such as:

- **Audience Size**: Naturally, the larger the audience, the higher the price. Influencers with several million followers can fetch several thousand dollars for a single shoutout. 

- **Audience Engagement**: While having a large audience seems advantageous, it doesn‚Äôt mean much if there‚Äôs little engagement to go along with it. In fact, some influencers with just a couple hundred followers can generate more sales for your business than influencers with millions of followers, simply because their audience is more engaged. 

- **Niche**: Twitch influencers whose audiences focus on niches like travel, fitness, or technology can charge higher rates for sponsorships because they cater to a more affluent audience.

- **Reputation and Experience**: Finally, the influencer‚Äôs reputation can have a big impact on pricing. An influencer that‚Äôs been around for years and has a proven track record of success can charge higher rates than someone who‚Äôs just starting out. 

### üëÄ Finding Influencers

Now that you know how much to pay for collaborations with Vietnamese Twitch influencers, the next step is finding the right ones for your brand. 

Fortunately, there are several influencer marketing platforms to help you connect with influencers. Here are three of the top platforms you can use to find Twitch influencers:

- **HypeAuditor**: HypeAuditor is a comprehensive influencer marketing platform that specializes in finding influencers across all major social media platforms, including Twitch. Using HypeAuditor, you can search for Twitch influencers by views, engagement rate, or follower count. 

- **Grapevine**: If you‚Äôre looking for a large pool of influencers to choose from, Grapevine is the platform for you. This platform has a massive influencer database with a variety of influencers across multiple social media platforms. 

- **UPFLUENCE**: UPFLUENCE is an all-in-one influencer platform that connects brands with influencers, streamlines campaigns, and tracks performance. This platform offers a variety of influencer marketing tools that are easy to use and provide clear results. 

### ‚ùì Legal Considerations

Finally, here are a few legal considerations to keep in mind when working with Vietnamese Twitch influencers:

- **Disclosure**: Like most countries around the world, influencers in Vietnam are required by law to disclose when they receive payment or free products in exchange for advertising a brand. Though it is technically up to the influencers themselves to disclose, make sure to emphasize this to avoid any penalties on your end. 

- **Taxes**: Unlike in the United States, where tax withholding is common, in Vietnam, taxpayers must take the initiative to pay their taxes. As such, it is common for influencers to request net payment amounts that have already had taxes withheld.  Additionally, any payment made to influencers may incur a flat 10% withholding tax imposed by the Vietnamese government. 

- **Contracts**: Ensure you use contracts to outline the specifics of your arrangement with the influencer so that both parties are protected in the event of a dispute. 

### üîö Takeaway

As you can see, the prices for sponsored content from Vietnamese Twitch influencers vary widely depending on a number of different factors. 

Use this guide to help you determine how much the influencers you‚Äôre interested in working with should charge for their services, and don‚Äôt forget to emphasize the importance of disclosure and contracts to avoid any issues.
