## üìä Influencer Marketing in Malaysia

Malaysia is one of the biggest influencers and social media users in the world. According to statistics, about 57% of Malaysians are active social media users, and the country ranks second among Southeast Asian countries in influencer marketing spending.

With Malaysia experiencing rapid growth in social media use and influencer marketing, it is expected that total social media ad spending will reach $370 million in 2025.

From Instagram to TikTok, influencer marketing is a key trend in Malaysia, with over 50% of marketers indicating influencer marketing is their most effective marketing strategy.

## üí° How Much Do Malaysian Influencers Charge?

Like most countries, the cost of hiring influencers in Malaysia varies based on several factors, including the influencer's reach, marketing strategy, marketing goals, and social media platform.

According to statistics by The Influencer Marketing Hub, Instagram influencers in Malaysia charge an average of RM1,000 to RM4,000 for an Instagram post, while micro and macro influencers charge RM275 to RM1,500 and RM1,500 to RM2,500 per post, respectively.

In 2025, it is expected that Malaysian influencers will charge more, with micro and macro influencers charging RM300 to RM1,800 and RM3,000 to RM4,500, respectively. However, the cost of hiring influencers will not exceed USD 1,000.

Here is a comprehensive list of influencer rates in Malaysia.

|Mega (1M+ followers)|RM8,275 ($1,800)|RM25,000 ($5,600)|

### üíµ Factors Influencing the Cost of Hiring Malaysian Influencers

1. **Influencer Type**

The first factor that affects influencer pricing is the type of influencer you want to hire and the type of campaign they are running. 

There are generally four types of influencers: nano, micro, macro, and mega influencers. 

Nano influencers have less than 10k followers, micro influencers have 10k to 100k followers, macro influencers have 500k to 1M followers, and mega influencers have over 1M followers.

The bigger the influencer, the higher the rates, as they have a larger reach and can influence more people.

2. **Social Media Platform**

The social media platform also affects the cost of hiring influencers. 

For example, Instagram influencers in Malaysia charge an average of RM1,000 to RM4,000 for one post, while TikTok influencers charge RM1,500 to RM5,000.

Here is a breakdown of the average influencer marketing rates in Malaysia based on the social media platform.

|Platform|Average Cost per Post|
|------|------|
|Instagram|RM1,000 ($225)|
|TikTok|RM1,800 ($400)|
|YouTube|RM2,300 ($500)|
|Facebook|RM800 ($175)|

3. **Campaign Type**

The type of campaign and marketing strategies also affect influencer pricing. Influencers can promote your brand through sponsored posts, product reviews, giveaways, or contests.

For example, YouTube product reviews in Malaysia charge between RM3,000 to RM8,000, while contests can cost up to RM15,000. 

4. **Influencer Engagement Rate**

The influencer engagement rate is another important factor that affects influencer pricing.

Engagement rate refers to the number of followers engaging with the influencer's content (likes, comments, and shares) compared to the total number of followers. 

Influencers with higher engagement rates tend to charge more, as they are more effective at influencing and converting their followers.

For example, Malaysian influencers with an engagement rate of over 6% charge an average of RM2,000 ($450) more than influencers with a 2% engagement rate.

5. **Influencer Niche**

Influencer niche can also affect influencer pricing. Some niches are more lucrative than others, and influencers in these niches tend to charge more.

For instance, beauty, fashion, and health influencers charge an average of RM2,000 to RM10,000 per post, while travel, food, and lifestyle influencers charge RM1,000 to RM4,000.

6. **Campaign Duration**

The duration of the campaign also affects influencer pricing. Long-term campaigns, such as ambassadorships, tend to be more expensive than one-time promotions.

For example, Malaysian influencers charge an average of RM5,000 to RM20,000 for long-term collaborations, while one-time promotions can cost RM2,000 to RM15,000.

7. **Product vs Cash Compensation**

The last factor that can affect influencer pricing is the compensation type. Some influencers may be willing to accept products as compensation instead of cash.

For example, Malaysian influencers charge an average of RM1,000 for cash compensation, but only RM500 if they also receive a product worth RM500.

One of the easiest ways to hire influencers in Malaysia is to use an influencer marketing agency. Using an influencer marketing agency in Malaysia will save you time, effort, and resources.

You will not have to go through the hassle of finding influencers, negotiating prices, and managing influencer campaigns.

2. **Focus on Engagement Rate, Not Follower Count**

When hiring influencers, it is important to focus on engagement rate rather than follower count. 

An influencer with a smaller following but a higher engagement rate is more effective than an influencer with a larger following but a lower engagement rate. 

Focus on influencers who have a genuine connection with their followers, as they are more likely to influence and convert them.

3. **Ask Influencers for Their Media Kit**

Before hiring influencers, ask them for their media kit. A media kit is a document that contains information about the influencer, such as their bio, audience demographics, engagement rate, and previous collaborations.

A media kit will help you determine whether the influencer is a good fit for your brand and whether they can deliver results.

4. **Check Influencers' Previous Collaborations**

When hiring influencers, check their previous collaborations. This will give you an idea of the types of brands they have worked with, the campaigns they have run, and the results they have achieved.

Choosing influencers who have worked with brands similar to yours will increase the chances of success for your campaign.

5. **Avoid Influencers with Fake Followers or Engagement**

There are many influencers out there with fake followers and engagement. Hiring these influencers will be a waste of time and resources, as they will not be able to deliver results.

To avoid hiring influencers with fake followers or engagement, use tools like HypeAuditor, Social Blade, or FakeCheck. These tools can help you analyze the authenticity of an influencer's followers and engagement.
