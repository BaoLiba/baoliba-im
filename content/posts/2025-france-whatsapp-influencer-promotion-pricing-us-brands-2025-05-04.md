In 2025, American brands looking to break into the French market will fork over about $500 per post to local influencers on WhatsApp.

In France, WhatsApp is the most popular messaging app, boasting 30 million users, with the majority of them aged 25 to 34. Meanwhile, the application accounts for 40% of total messaging app usage in the country.

Given its status as the nation‚Äôs go-to messaging platform, WhatsApp is a crucial avenue for influencer marketing in France. Local creators now charge American brands a premium to promote their goods and services on the platform.

Influencers on WhatsApp offer several promotional packages for American brands, with the most basic one costing $400. For this price, brands get one message that includes up to two photos, and no video. French influencers also promise to send the message to at least 20 people, with many claiming they reach at least 40 contacts.

In France, a message on WhatsApp can only be sent to a total of 256 people at one time, so many influencers work in conjunction with others to promote a brand to a wider audience.

### French WhatsApp Influencer Pricing

In addition to the basic package costing $400, influencers on WhatsApp in France offer more expensive options, with some going as high as $900, depending on the package.

According to a report by France‚Äôs Le Monde, pricing for WhatsApp influencer promotions vary greatly. For example, some influencers charge brands on a pay-per-click basis. This means brands have to pay per person who responds to the message. However, others charge based only on the number of messages sent.

Overall, prices depend on the influencer‚Äôs size and popularity. In France, influencers are categorized into four levels, with megastars charging the most while nano influencers cost the least.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of pricing for WhatsApp influencer promotions in France in 2025:

- **Megastars**  ‚Äì $800 to $900 per post
- **Macro** ‚Äì $600 to $700 per post
- **Micro** ‚Äì $500 to $600 per post
- **Nano** ‚Äì $400 to $500 per post

An influencer with less than 1,000 followers is considered a nano influencer, while someone with 1,000 to 10,000 followers is classified as a micro influencer.  A macro influencer has 10,000 to 100,000 followers, while anyone with more than that is called a megastar.

### ü§≥ Who Are They?

The biggest WhatsApp influencers in France have millions of followers on other social media platforms, particularly Instagram and TikTok. Many of them also have their own websites, where they regularly post blogs about their lives. Some are even celebrities, such as actors, musicians, and athletes.

One of the most well-known influencers on WhatsApp in France is David Lichtenstein, also known as Mister Lichtenstein, who has over 1.8 million followers on Instagram and 2.3 million on TikTok. He is also a singer and a TV host who has participated in several reality shows. He has 117,000 subscribers on YouTube.

Mister Lichtenstein regularly promotes brands on his WhatsApp account, where his followers can also access exclusive content. He has been called the French equivalent of Mister Beast, who runs a popular YouTube channel where he gives away money and other prizes.

Another WhatsApp influencer in France is Tibo InShape, who has over 1 million followers on Instagram and 10 million subscribers on YouTube. He is a bodybuilder and internet entrepreneur who promotes fitness-related products on his WhatsApp account.

One more famous WhatsApp influencer in France is Michou, who is a comedian and internet personality. He has 6.5 million subscribers on YouTube, where he posts videos of his comedic skits, and 2 million followers on Instagram.

Like Mister Lichtenstein, Michou‚Äôs WhatsApp account gives followers access to exclusive content, including selfies and videos that they can‚Äôt see anywhere else. He also holds competitions on his WhatsApp account, where he gives away prizes. 

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Why WhatsApp?

WhatsApp is popular in France and many other countries because it allows users to send and receive messages without being bombarded by advertisements, unlike other messaging apps.

WhatsApp messaging is encrypted, so users feel safe communicating with friends and family, and also brands and influencers. Plus, it‚Äôs free, so people can use it as they would a text message, except they‚Äôre not limited by the number of people they can message.

In France, sending an SMS costs about 0.05 euros, while sending a message on WhatsApp is free. SMS services in France have been declining for years as more people use WhatsApp instead.

According to a report by the French internet and mobile association, Arcep, SMS services in France fell 52% over a period of 10 years, from 2010 to 2020. During that same time, the use of messaging apps, especially WhatsApp, grew 63%.

### üìâ Future

By 2025, WhatsApp will have around 51 million users in France.  More than 70% of France‚Äôs population uses the app, which is the highest percentage of any country in Europe.

The popularity of WhatsApp in France, coupled with its growing use by influencers to promote brands, means that American brands will likely be spending much more on WhatsApp influencer promotions in the near future.

According to a report by PR Newswire, the global influencer marketing industry is expected to grow from $16.4 billion in 2022 to $84.89 billion by 2028, at a compound annual growth rate of 32.4 percent.

WhatsApp influencer promotions are likely to increase tremendously over the next few years, especially in France, where it‚Äôs the most popular messaging app by far. In fact, recent data shows that WhatsApp accounts for over 40% of total messaging app usage in France.

### ‚ùóRisks

While WhatsApp influencer promotions in France may seem like a lucrative opportunity for American brands looking to break into the French market, there are risks that come with it. 

One of the biggest dangers brands face when working with WhatsApp influencers in France is dealing with scammers.  Since WhatsApp is an open platform, anyone can say they‚Äôre an influencer without any proof, such as followers, likes, or shares.

Some scammers say they‚Äôll promote a brand‚Äôs products and services for a fee, but after getting paid, they vanish. They may also send the brand a promotional message from their WhatsApp account, but it‚Äôs to their own contact list, which usually consists of family and friends.

Also, while many influencers on WhatsApp in France have large followings, that doesn‚Äôt mean their followers will purchase a brand‚Äôs products or services. Many followers are only interested in exclusive content from the influencer, not what they‚Äôre promoting.

### üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë How to Collaborate with WhatsApp Influencers in France

Working with WhatsApp influencers in France is similar to collaborating with influencers on other social media platforms. 

American brands looking to break into the French market must determine their target audience, and then find WhatsApp influencers who can reach them. 

When searching for influencers, brands should look for those who have followers that match their target audience demographics. They should also check if the influencer has a good engagement rate, meaning a high number of likes, shares, comments, and other interactions.

Once they find an influencer they want to work with, brands should reach out to them with a personalized message. They should say why they want to work with the influencer and how it will benefit them. 

After making the deal, brands must pay the influencer and provide them with the necessary details for the promotional message. Once the influencer sends the promotional message, the brand should check if it met their standards. 

If the brand is satisfied with the message, they can discuss future collaborations with the influencer. If they‚Äôre not happy with the message, they can try asking the influencer for a do-over.

Ultimately, if an American brand wants to increase sales in France, working with WhatsApp influencers is a must. According to an article in Forbes, nearly 50% of consumers say they rely on influencer recommendations when making a purchase. The article also states that 70% of marketers say they don‚Äôt use influencers, which means brands that do will stand out from their competitors.

Not only will working with WhatsApp influencers in France help American brands reach new customers, but they‚Äôll also be seen as industry leaders. In fact, about 86% of marketing experts believe that influencer marketing is an effective strategy. 

### üè¶ How to Pay

American brands can pay WhatsApp influencers in France using different payment methods, but it depends on the influencer‚Äôs preference. 

Many influencers require direct payment, which usually involves sending the money through a third-party payment service. One of the most popular payment services in France is PayPal, which allows users to send and receive money for free.

In France, people can also send and receive money through Venmo, which is owned by PayPal. Other popular payment services in France that influencers may use include TransferWise, Revolut, and N26, which is a mobile banking app. 

However, some influencers may prefer payment in goods and services instead of money. For example, some food influencers want brands to send them free products. Others may want discounts at a brand‚Äôs restaurant or free hotel rooms at a brand‚Äôs resort. 

### üåé Conclusion

WhatsApp influencer promotions in France are a growing trend that American brands should capitalize on to increase sales in the French market.

Not only do influencers in France charge brands a premium to promote them on WhatsApp, but they also have millions of followers on other social media platforms. Many of them are even celebrities, which means American brands that work with them will benefit from their massive audiences.

Although there are risks involved when working with influencers on WhatsApp in France, the rewards greatly outweigh them. Brands just need to make sure they work with reliable influencers who can reach their target audience.

While prices for WhatsApp influencer promotions in France vary, they start at around $400 and can go as high as $900, depending on the influencer‚Äôs size and popularity.
