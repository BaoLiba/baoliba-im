In America, when it comes to influencer marketing, many brands focus on Instagram, TikTok, or YouTube. However, for brands trying to reach a Korean audience, it may be time to add Naver Blog to their strategy.

In South Korea, 30 million users visit Naver Blog every month, making it a popular platform for both content consumers and Naver influencers. Naver Blog monetization is also becoming more common. Influencers publish content as part of paid collaborations with brands, allowing them to earn money from Naver Blog marketing.

If you are an American brand interested in advertising on Naver Blog, you need to understand the pricing and expectations of Naver influencers. This article will outline what you can expect when partnering with Naver bloggers.


## 💸 Naver Blog Influencer Pricing for Brands

A successful Naver blog collaboration can reach over half a million users. However, you can expect to pay Naver influencers between $200 to $5000 for sponsored content, depending on their influence and reach. 

Although Naver influencers can earn a lot from Naver advertising, most influencers only earn an average of around $310 from blog collaborations. 

This is an appealing price for American brands looking to promote their products on Korean blogs. 


## 🤔 Basic Costs of a Naver Blog Sponsored Post

Here are common Naver blog prices to expect from different tiers of Naver influencers. These prices are mostly based on the influencer's follower count.

| Tier              | Followers      | Cost         | Extra Posts | Video Costs |
|-------------------|----------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|

## 📈 65% of Korean Consumers Trust Naver Blog Advice

Korean consumers view Naver blogs as a reliable source of information. 65% of Korean consumers say opinions shared on Naver blogs influence their purchasing decisions. 

This high level of trust makes Naver blogs a valuable asset in Korean influencer marketing. 

American brands can expect to see significant engagement and response from Korean audiences when advertising their products through a Naver blog campaign. 
 


## 🎯 Shorter Sponsored Blog Posts Cost Less

When Naver bloggers work with brands, they can write different types of sponsored blog posts. A few different options can change the pricing:

- **Full-length Article**: This is typically around 1,500 words and costs the most.
- **Short Article**: This could be around 800 words and costs less than a full-length article.
- **Text Link**: This is the cheapest option. A Naver blogger can add only a link to the post and will not write any additional text.



## 🎬 You Can Create Your Own Video for Naver Blogs

Often, Naver bloggers will create their own videos to promote brands. However, this can be an additional cost on top of the Naver blog prices listed above.

Many brands looking to create a low-cost Naver blog marketing campaign can create their own video. Naver blogs will accept videos created by brands. 

This allows brands to save costs and better promote their messages.


## 💵 American Brands Should Use Won to Pay Korean Partners

Although your American brand will pay Naver influencers, Korean influencers often prefer to receive payment in their local currency. The South Korean won (₩) is the currency used in South Korea. 

Most Korean influencers will insist on being paid in won instead of dollars. 

American brands can avoid any additional charges by using a currency conversion service. Several options will convert your dollar amount into won and send it to the Naver influencer’s bank account. 

One recommended currency conversion service is Wise. They have a low conversion fee compared to other services, such as PayPal.  


## 🏦 Korean Influencers Prefer Direct Bank Transfers

In America, it is common for influencers to receive payments through escrow services, PayPal, or business accounts. However, many Korean influencers prefer to be paid directly through their bank.

When American brands contact Naver influencers, they need to be prepared to provide their business information. This includes providing their business's name, account number, and bank code. 

This level of detail may make it more difficult for some American brands to complete a Naver blog collaboration. 


## 💬 Naver Blog Statements Are Used as Contracts

In America, escrow services are often used as the middleman for influencer contracts. A brand deposits the agreed amount into an escrow account. Then, after the Naver blog is published, the escrow service releases the funds to the influencer. 

However, this process can be challenging for American brands working with Naver influencers since many prefer direct bank transfers. 

Thus, Korean influencers often use Naver blog statements as contracts instead. When the influencer is paid, they will provide a statement showing the payment. This statement serves as proof of payment to the influencer, ensuring a successful collaboration. 


## 📊 Naver Blog Marketing is Growing

In 2018, only 56% of Korean consumers trusted Naver blogs. Now, that percentage has grown to 65%, meaning more and more consumers are relying on Naver blogs for their purchasing decisions. 

Interestingly, this growth has increased marketing costs for Korean influencers. 

In 2020, the average amount Korean influencers earned from advertising was $273. In 2023, that average has reached $310.
