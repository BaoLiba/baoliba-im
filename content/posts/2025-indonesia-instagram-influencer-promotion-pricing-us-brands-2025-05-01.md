| Influencer Tier | Average Cost Per Post (Indonesia) (IDR) | Average Cost Per Post (Indonesia) (USD) | Average Cost Per Post (USA) (USD) |
|------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Nano Influencer  | 300,000 - 500,000                       | 20 - 35                                  | 80 - 300                            |

It is important to note that while costs are lower in Indonesia, brands should not assume that influencer marketing will be cheaper in Indonesia. 

In fact, according to Prahlad Prabhakar of PR Newswire, "The price per post is lower but the price per engagement is higher for Indonesian influencers," meaning that brands will often get less value for their money when collaborating with Indonesian influencers.
