### ðŸ’¡ How to Work with Japanese Clubhouse Influencers

Because Clubhouse isnâ€™t as heavily used among the younger generations in Japan, the process of working with a Clubhouse influencer is much the same as working with influencers on other platforms.

To work with a Clubhouse influencer in Japan, begin by conducting research to find the best influencers to fit your brand.

Once you have a list of potential influencers to collaborate with, reach out to them through direct messages on their social profiles or through their email. Many profiles will have an email link that will bring you to a form you can fill out, detailing your request.

When reaching out to the influencer, be sure to include:

- A brief introduction of your brand
- Details of what you are looking for in a collaboration
- Any relevant links to your brand or website
- Your contact information

If the influencer is interested in working with your brand, they will respond with their rates and availability.


### ðŸ“ž Tips to work with Japanese Clubhouse Influencers

- **Chances of success:** Clubhouse influencers in Japan are more open to accepting collaboration requests than influencers on other platforms. This means you have a higher chance of success when reaching out to Clubhouse influencers.
- **Go native:** If you donâ€™t speak Japanese, consider hiring a fluent speaker to write your messages to Japanese Clubhouse influencers to reduce the chances of your messages being ignored due to the language barrier.
- **Discuss payment:** For Japanese Clubhouse influencers, payment is usually expected in advance of the collaboration. Be sure to discuss payment details with the influencer before the collaboration.

### ðŸ”’ Ensuring the Safety of Your Payment 

To further ensure the safety of your payment, consider paying through a third-party service. Not only is this a good way to secure your payment, but many third-party services will also help facilitate communication between you and the Clubhouse influencer.

Here are a few third-party services you can use to secure your Clubhouse influencer payment: 

- PayPal
- Escrow.com
- PaymentCloud

### ðŸ“¢ The Benefits of Working with Japanese Clubhouse Influencers

- **Great Reach:** According to a survey conducted by KDDI, Clubhouse penetration in Japan is higher than that of any other country in the world. Although Clubhouse is on the decline in the West, it has emerged as one of the top social media platforms in Japan, making Clubhouse influencers highly sought after. 
- **Itâ€™s FREE:** Clubhouse is completely free to use, which makes it a much more appealing platform for Japanese influencers to build a following compared to other platforms that require in-app purchases or costly subscriptions.
- **High Engagement:** Clubhouse is unique among social platforms because it is a live audio-only format. This allows Clubhouse influencers to engage with their followers in a more authentic way compared to text or video platforms.


### ðŸ’¬ Differences Between Japanese Clubhouse Influencers and Influencers on other platforms

When working with Japanese influencers on other platforms, you can expect to receive deliverables such as posts and videos. However, when working with a Clubhouse influencer in Japan, the deliverable you will receive is an hour-long live discussion on Clubhouse, which can also be recorded and shared by the influencer to their other platforms.

Because of this major difference in content deliverables, the process of measuring the effectiveness of your campaign will also differ.

Here are a few ways to measure the effectiveness of your campaign when working with a Japanese Clubhouse influencer: 

- Clubhouse analytics tools, such as Clubhouse Stats and Clubhouse Insights
- Posts made by the influencer promoting the Clubhouse discussion on other platforms
- Comments posted by listeners during the discussion
- Comments and engagement received after the discussion
