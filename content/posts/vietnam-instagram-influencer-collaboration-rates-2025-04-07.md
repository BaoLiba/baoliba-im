In recent years, Vietnamese Instagram influencers have become very popular in the United States. With more than 76 million active users, Instagram is an important part of digital marketing strategies across the country. By 2025, marketing through Vietnam-based influencers on Instagram will be one of the fastest-growing sectors in the entire marketing landscape.

For US-based brands like Ray-Ban and The North Face, collaborating with Vietnamese influencers on Instagram is a great way to promote their products and services. Among them, Ray-Ban is a classic example of a brand that has implemented successful influencer marketing campaigns in Vietnam. In 2025, Ray-Ban will continue to take advantage of this potent marketing strategy to reach out to Vietnamese youth.

## üìä Understand influencer pricing

Although influencer marketing on Instagram is extremely lucrative, many US brands struggle to find the right sources of Vietnamese influencers. The first step is understanding the pricing system used to categorize Vietnamese Instagram influencers.

### The pricing system

Vietnamese influencers can be categorized into different levels based on their follower count. This classification helps create a more accurate pricing structure for promotional posts on Instagram. 

- **Mega-influencers**: More than 1 million followers
- **Macro-influencers**: 500,000 - 1 million followers
- **Mid-tier influencers**: 100,000 - 500,000 followers
- **Micro-influencers**: 1,000 - 100,000 followers

### Cost range

As you can see from the table below, the cost of promotional posts by Vietnamese influencers is relatively lower than many other countries, especially among mid-tier and macro influencers.

| **Influencer Type**                      | **Follower Count**         | **Cost per Post**                     |
|------------------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Mega-influencers                         | 1 million+                 | $1,500 - $2,000                       |
| Macro-influencers                        | 500,000 - 1 million        | $800 - $1,500                         |
| Mid-tier influencers                     | 100,000 - 500,000          | $300 - $800                           |
| Micro-influencers                        | 1,000 - 100,000            | $100 - $300                           |

#### Bonus: Additional costs

Besides the promotional post price, there are often additional costs involved in collaborating with Vietnamese influencers. They may charge extra for posting on their story, creating videos, or sharing permanent posts.

In some instances, they may even require payment in advance. This is why knowing how to find trustworthy sources of Vietnamese influencers is critical to your success.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Be aware of red flags

Vietnam has a long and complex history with corrupt officials and untrustworthy businesses. Moreover, the country still struggles with concrete laws and regulations regarding social media. For these reasons, your future collaborations with Vietnamese influencers could be hindered if you fail to spot the red flags that indicate potential scammers.

### Poor engagement rate

Unfortunately, many influencers artificially inflate their follower numbers to deceive brands into believing they have larger audiences. Thus, another significant metric to consider is an influencer's engagement rate, which measures the ratio of likes and comments to total followers.

A rate higher than 3% is considered good, while a figure lower than 1% suggests that a large portion of that influencer's followers may be fake accounts.

### Unprofessionalism

Shouldered with the responsibility of promoting your brand, Vietnamese influencers need to strike a balance between showcasing their own creativity and maintaining your original intent.

A true professional will respect your ideas, produce high-quality content, and deliver it on time. If they frequently miss deadlines, ignore your requests, or produce low-quality work, they may not be the right fit for you.

### Payment in advance

Many Vietnamese Instagram influencers require brands to pay upfront before they deliver any content. While this is not automatically a red flag, as mentioned earlier, it is wise to be cautious.

You can conduct due diligence on the influencer and their agency to see if they are reputable. If they do have a reliable source, consider using secure payment portals that retain payment until the influencer fulfills their end of the deal.

## ‚úÖ Work with a trustworthy agency

Despite the red flags associated with Vietnamese influencers, that does not mean you should give up on the idea altogether. On the contrary, many brands have already collaborated with Vietnamese influencers on Instagram and enjoyed tremendous success.

One way to help mitigate potential risks is by hiring an agency you can trust, like IGVY. They represent a variety of Vietnamese influencers and are experienced at helping brands like yours find the right ones for their needs. They will walk you through each step of the process so that you can enjoy peace of mind and focus on taking care of other business matters.

## üîó Conclusion

In 2025, Vietnamese Instagram influencers will continue to become increasingly popular in the United States. As a result, their clients will need to be prepared for the pricing structure they adhere to, as well as potential scams that may arise.

However, by conducting thorough research and working with trustworthy agencies, they can enjoy the many benefits of influencer marketing while avoiding pitfalls commonly experienced by newcomers to this strategy.

To maximize your chances of success, consider collaborating with Vietnamese influencers who align closely with your brand. By doing so, you can cultivate partnerships that endure well beyond a single Instagram post.
