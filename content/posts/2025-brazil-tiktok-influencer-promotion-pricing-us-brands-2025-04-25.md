Brazil is home to the second largest user base on TikTok, with an impressive 70 million active users. This figure sounds sweet to the ears of American marketers hunting for new territories to conquer.

However, if you're an American marketer looking to reach Brazilian TikTok users, you need to know that influencer promotion prices differ vastly from what you may be used to back home.

Letâ€™s take a look at what American brands should expect to pay for Brazilian TikTok influencer promotions in 2025.



## ðŸ“¢ Brazil is a TikTok powerhouse

Brazil has firmly established itself as one of TikTok's most fervent markets, boasting the platform's highest daily engagement rate. According to a report from the marketing intelligence platform, Statista, Brazil ranks first in spending time on TikTok, averaging 23.2 hours monthly per user. That's four hours more than the global average.

It's also interesting to note that the Brazilian TikTok user base increased by 145.8% between 2020 and 2023. TikTok will celebrate its fifth anniversary in Brazil on October 2025, and the platform shows no signs of slowing down.

More than 99% of Brazilian marketers have reported that TikTok has performed better than other marketing channels. On average, Brazilian businesses have reported an 80% increase in sales due to marketing on TikTok. 

In 2025, Brazilian TikTok users are estimated to spend around $8.62 billion dollars on e-commerce, and the platform continues to be a formidable marketing tool for businesses of all sizes.



## ðŸ’¡ Brazilian TikTok influencer promotion pricing vs. the USA

Just as Americans have become accustomed to TikTok influencer pricing here at home, we also know that costs can vary widely depending on the market. Brazil is no different. 

In general, Brazilian TikTok influencer promotions cost anywhere from 25% to 50% less than what a comparable TikTok promotion would cost in the USA.

For example, Brazilian influencer marketing platform, Dok3, lists the following prices for TikTok promotions in Brazil:

- Nano influencer promotion: $85-135 per post
- Micro influencer promotion: $135-225 per post
- Mid-tier influencer promotion: $225-400 per post
- Macro influencer promotion: $400-1000 per post
- Mega influencer promotion: $1,000-1,500 per post

### ðŸ’² TikTok influencer pricing in the USA

If we compare these rates with the American TikTok influencer promotion prices offered by influencers on platforms like TikTok itself, or Fiverr, or through influencer marketing agencies like The Shelf, we see the following: 

- Nano influencer promotion: $150-300
- Micro influencer promotion: $300-1,000
- Mid-tier influencer promotion: $1,000-1,500
- Macro influencer promotion: $1,500-3,000
- Mega influencer promotion: $3,000-10,000+


These figures alone hint at how much less American brands can expect to pay for Brazilian TikTok promotions, especially at the upper-tier end of influencer categories.



## ðŸŒŽ How US brands pay for Brazilian TikTok promotions

As payment methods are often a major consideration for American brands, it is also important to understand how they differ. 

Payment methods that are popular in the USA often differ from those preferred in Brazil. For example, credit cards account for 67% of online payments in the USA but only 24% in Brazil. 

According to a study by Adyen, a payments technology company, Brazilian consumers prefer the use of installment plans when it comes to paying for goods and services. In fact, 46% of respondents cited the ability to purchase something via installments as a crucial aspect of any transaction.

As such, American brands should expect to pay for Brazilian TikTok promotions using a payment method that facilitates installment payments. 

The most widely used payment processor in Brazil is PagSeguro, which specializes in e-commerce transactions. Other popular options include Mercadopago, Moip, and PayPal.

## ðŸ‘‘ How to find Brazilian TikTok influencers

Aside from payment methods, Brazilian influencers often differ in their advertising requirements compared to their American counterparts. 

In Brazil, influencer marketing is governed under the Brazilian Code of Advertising Self-Regulation. This code requires paid endorsements to be clearly labeled throughout the advertisement. 

In fact, the Brazilian advertising code mandates the following:

1. Paid endorsements should include the word "publicidade" (advertisement) prominently embedded within the content.

2. Influencers must disclose the brand relationship with a verbal or written message. 

3. Influencer endorsements that do not comply with the guidelines may result in fines or removal of the post.

The good news is that American brands can easily find compliant Brazilian TikTok influencers to promote their products and services through influencer marketing platforms.

Worldwide influencer marketing platform BaoLiba offers a variety of influencer marketing services, including the ability to connect brands with influencers for compliant paid promotions on TikTok and other major platforms.
