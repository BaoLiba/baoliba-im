It has been discovered that Joox influencers charge an average of 4,500 Baht (~139.27 USD) for a single advertisement on their profile, amid other jobs that pay much higher for content creators.


## üìä Joox Influencer Pricing Compared to Thailand Government Salary

Various internet research has shown that Joox influencers make an average of 4,500 Baht ~139.27 USD per collaboration on the app. This earnings amount is quite low, given that the average salary of government employees in Thailand is around 14k Baht ~433.50 USD according to the latest reports.

This statistic shows that Joox influencers make only about one-third of the earnings of a typical government employee in Thailand for their content creation services.

## üíµ Payment Mode Used By Joox Influencers

Joox influencers can receive their payments through the most common payment platforms in Thailand including:

- **PayPal:** An online money transfer service that allows users to send and receive funds through a secure internet account.
- **Wise:** An online banking and payment service that provides a more efficient money transfer. 
- **PromptPay:** An Instant Bank Transfer service for Thai banks that allows for swift money transfers using only a phone number or National ID number.
- **Bank Transfer:** Influencers can also receive payments directly to their bank accounts.

## üí° How To Become A Joox Influencer

According to Joox, to become an influencer on their platform you must have at least:

1. **A solid account** with a substantial number of followers (likely between 1,000 to 10,000) on Joox.
2. **Joox must recognize you** as a popular influencer on their platform. 

It should be noted that Joox has not yet unveiled a signature procedure or platform to facilitate influencer registration at this time, unlike other social media platforms that formally designate influencers on their apps.


## ‚ùó Thai Joox Influencers Are Banned From Showing Their Faces?

It has been said that Joox influencers are banned from showing their faces or any form of personal expression in their videos and photos, and the platform has also threatened to ban accounts that are found violating these rules. 

This restriction likely stems from the fact that Joox is primarily a music platform and they want to maintain brand objectivity on their app. 

These restrictions means that Joox influencers must find clever and creative ways to convey messages in their promotional posts, which likely accounts for why their pricing is lower than other social media platforms and apps.
