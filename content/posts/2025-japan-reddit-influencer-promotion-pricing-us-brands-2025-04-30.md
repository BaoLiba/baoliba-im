2025 is going to be a tough year if you're a US brand trying to promote products and services in Japan using Reddit influencers.  

Finding an influencer to promote your brand on Reddit has always been a hard nut to crack in Japan. The majority of Japanese Reddit users still see Reddit as an English-speaking platform, so influencer promotions are rare.  

The few influencers that do exist have so far kept their teams small and their marketing budgets even smaller. This might sound good for brands looking for low-cost promotions, but it actually means that the influencer marketing scene is not as competitive as it should be. Because of this, we expect that Japanese Reddit influencers will mark up their prices significantly in 2025.  

A lack of competitors usually results in a lack of innovation and creativity in terms of marketing strategies and tactics. If brands want to get cheap promotions, all they have to do is click the ‚ÄúAsk for Quote‚Äù button on their selected influencer's profile page.  

But in 2025, it's likely that influencers will no longer feel the need to keep their prices low. With inflation and a rising cost of living across Japan, US brands should expect promotions to be at least 20% higher than in 2024.  

We know that this might sound scary, but there are ways to avoid getting burned in 2025. Keep reading as we outline everything you need to know about Reddit influencer marketing in Japan.  

## üè™ Why Reddit Influencer Promotions are Rare in Japan

Although the majority of Japanese nationals are familiar with Reddit, and even use it frequently, they prefer to use it in English.  

This is not surprising, as Reddit is known for its English-speaking community and majority of posts are also in English.  

Because of this, many Japanese nationals don't bother to even create an account on the platform in their native language.  

In fact, research has shown that only 2% of Reddit's overall visitors are Japanese, and even fewer are native Japanese speakers.  

This might seem like a small number, but Japan is actually one of the top 15 countries to visit Reddit.  

But although Reddit is highly popular among Japanese nationals, it is not a very competitive space for influencers and brands to promote products and services.  

## üè∑Ô∏è Where Are All the Japanese Reddit Influencers? 

You might be surprised to learn that Japan is actually home to a select few of the biggest influencers on Reddit. There are currently eight of them, although only six are English-speaking.  

The first two influencers are both based in Japan and have millions of followers. 

1. **r/japan2** - 3.1 million subscribers
2. **r/JapanPics** - 2.7 million subscribers
3. **r/japan** - 1.2 million subscribers  
4. **r/JapanGeneral** - 876k subscribers 
5. **r/JapanTravel** - 724k subscribers 
6. **r/JapanAnime** - 482k subscribers 

The remaining two influencers are both based in the US.

7. **r/Japan** - 1.2 million subscribers  
8. **r/JapanTravel** - 724k subscribers  

While there are many other subreddits about Japan, these are officially classified as the top eight.  

With the first six influencers based on their respective subreddit pages, you can clearly see that the majority of them are community-driven and moderated by Reddit users across the globe.  

This is indicative of Japanese nationals‚Äô preference to use Reddit in English, as well as their reluctance to get involved in the influencer marketing scene on Reddit.  

## ü•π Why Reddit Influencers Are Still a Viable Marketing Strategy

While it's true that Japan is lacking in Reddit influencers, that doesn't mean that influencer promotions are not a viable marketing strategy.  

In fact, Japanese nationals are some of the most active users on Reddit, spending around 15-45 minutes on Reddit each day.  

This means that while there may be few influencers around, there are still plenty of eyeballs to advertise to.  

Even if influencers were to charge brands a whopping 20% more for promotional campaigns in 2025, it would still be a steal compared to other platforms.  

Instagram, for example, is home to thousands of influencers across Japan, but many of them charge a minimum of $2000 per post.  

And YouTube is no different. With the same influencers charging up to $8000 for a video.  

But with Reddit influencers, brands can expect to pay no more than $280 per post.
