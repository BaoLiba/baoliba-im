Viber is the top messaging platform in Vietnam, boasting around 47 million active users regularly sending over 1 billion messages daily.

In terms of Vietnam's social media landscape, influencer marketing through Viber is analogous to collaborations on Facebook or Instagram in the West.  

Viber influencers are heavily engaged with their audiences, and utilizing their reach and impact can afford brands an unparalleled advertising opportunity within the Vietnamese intercultural communication system.   

Aligning with a Vietnamese Viber influencer can help American brands penetrate the lucrative Vietnamese market.

However, how much do Viber influencers charge for their services?

Here's a look at Vietnam's Viber influencer pricing model.

## üì£ Who are Viber Influencers?

Typically, Viber influencers in Vietnam are prominent Viber Public Accounts or Chat Groups.

**Viber Public Accounts** are brand-driven accounts that enable two-way communication with customers and potential customers. They can upload posts, share updates and information, and optimize account visibility through the app's search function. 

Public Accounts have many followers, and Viber influencers utilize their massive followings to disseminate advertising content on behalf of brands. 

**Viber Chat Groups** allow brands to generate a community of followers and create personalized interactions with them. They often include chat rooms, forums, and other features that encourage dialogue and collaboration between members. These chat groups can have thousands of members, and chat group influencers can spread brand-related content consistently to a dedicated audience. 

Influencers on both Public Accounts and Chat Groups are often established content creators who have built their audience through rich and engaging posts and effective communications with their followers. 


## üè∑Ô∏è Viber Influencer Marketing Pricing Approaches in Vietnam

Vietnamese Viber influencer pricing varies based on their marketing approaches. 

**Viber influencers can charge through flat fees or commission-based pricing.**  

A flat fee entails a brand paying a certain amount in advance for a service. 

For example, a Viber influencer may charge $300 to post three promotional messages about a brand across various Viber Chat groups. This is known as a flat-fee pricing model because the influencer charges a fixed amount for their promotional services. 

On the other hand, commission-based pricing entails a brand compensating an influencer based on the results of their promotional efforts.

For example, a Viber influencer may charge 10% of sales generated from their promotional activities. This is a commission-based pricing model because the influencer earns a percentage of the profits they help a brand generate.

As each pricing approach has its advantages and disadvantages, the most successful Viber influencers may employ a hybrid of both strategies to maximize their earnings.  


## üíµ Viber Influencer Marketing Flat Fee Pricing in Vietnam

While Viber influencer pricing depends on various factors, an independent influencer marketing agency that specializes in Vietnam estimates the average flat fees as follows:

1. **Public Accounts**  
   - Posting a promotional message: 150,000 ‚Äì 300,000 VND (6.50 ‚Äì 13 USD)  
   - Posting a promotional message to 50 Public Accounts: 1 million ‚Äì 2 million VND (44 ‚Äì 88 USD)

2. **Chat Groups**  
   - Posting a promotional message: 300,000 ‚Äì 500,000 VND (13 ‚Äì 22 USD)  
   - Posting a promotional message to 10 Chat Groups: 3 million ‚Äì 5 million VND (132 ‚Äì 220 USD)


## üìà Viber Influencer Marketing Commission-Based Pricing in Vietnam

**Prices of commission-based influencer marketing on Viber can vary greatly.** 

For example, a Viber influencer may charge a set percentage of sales for every item sold. In this case, a Viber influencer may charge 20% of sales if they get 20 people to purchase a product through their promotional efforts. 

Further breaking it down, if each item sold costs 200,000 VND, then the influencer would get 400,000 VND (17.50 USD).   

On the other hand, a Viber influencer may charge a percentage of profits instead of sales. For example, if each item sold costs 200,000 VND, and the profit margin is 50%, the amount charged by the influencer would be halved to 10%.

Despite their pricing being more unpredictable than flat-fee influencers, commission-based Viber influencers can achieve better overall returns on investment. 


## üíé Factors Affecting Viber Influencer Pricing in Vietnam

Several factors can affect a Viber influencer's pricing in Vietnam, including:

1. **Influencer Subscriber Count**: Generally, the higher the subscriber count of a Viber influencer, the more they can charge for their services. However, their engagement rates should also be considered before determining their actual value.

2. **Targeted Audience**: Viber influencers with specific audiences that align with a brand's target market may charge higher prices than influencers with a less-defined audience. For example, a Viber influencer that caters to the hospitality sector in Vietnam may charge higher fees than one that appeals to the general public. 

3. **Promotional Delivery Method**: The promotional delivery method can also influence pricing. For example, a Viber influencer may charge more for a personalized and interactive experience, such as hosting a live Q&A session, compared to just posting a static advertisement. 

4. **Deliverables**: The number of deliverables, including the frequency and duration of promotional content, can also affect pricing. For instance, an influencer may charge more for a series of posts compared to just one or two.

5. **Advertising Format**: The format of promotional content can influence Viber influencer pricing as well. For example, influencer-created videos may command higher fees than text-based messages. Viber scammers often use text-based messages, making them less valuable in comparison. 

6. **Campaign Length**: The duration of a promotional campaign can also affect pricing. Longer campaigns may require more investment and effort from influencers, justifying higher fees. 

7. **Reposting Rights**: If a brand wants to use a Viber influencer's content for its own marketing purposes, it may need to pay additional fees for reposting rights. 

8. **Brand Reputation**: Influencers may also consider the reputation and credibility of a brand when determining their pricing. Working with well-known or reputable brands can command higher fees for influencers.

9. **Negotiation**: Lastly, pricing is often subject to negotiation. Viber influencers may be open to discussing their fees and finding a mutually beneficial agreement with brands.
