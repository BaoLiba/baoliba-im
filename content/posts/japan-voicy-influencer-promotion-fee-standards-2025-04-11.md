Are you curious about how much Japanese influencers charge to promote products on Voicy? 

This popular audio platform has become a prominent tool for influencer marketing in Japan, making it easier for brands to connect with their consumers.   

In fact, the Voicy brand recently announced it would be raising the commission rates it charges influencers, an indication of how lucrative the platform has become for those who produce content on it.    

Established in 2014, Voicy allows influencers to launch their own talk radio station, a medium that remains popular with a core audience of consumers who prefer a more passive consumption of content.    

Podcasts and audio have become a staple of Japanese culture, with Tokyo residents often tuning into Voicy while commuting.    

As a testament to the platform‚Äôs growing popularity, Voicy has recently attracted significant investment from big players in the Japanese media industry, including TBS, a major television network, and CyberAgent, a powerful digital advertising agency.   

### The Importance of Audio Influencers 

Japan has become a frontline of influencer marketing, with brands increasingly turning to influencers for promotions.  

In fact, the market for influencer marketing in Japan is expected to reach 64.4 billion yen in 2025, or about $465 million dollars, and audio influencers are expected to play a significant role in this growth.  

Voicy has taken the lead in audio influencer marketing in Japan, with 50% of the content on the platform dedicated to promotions.  

Furthermore, 60% of the promotions on Voicy receive responses, ranging from the purchase of a promoted product to consumers following a brand on social media.  

**"While the overall response rate is around 5% for TV, magazines, and radio, that of Voicy influencer marketing ranges from 20% to 60%,"** Voicy announced in a recent press release on its website.   

**"This is because the influencers who actually use products and services introduce them, and the information is distributed directly to the target audience."**  

With predictions of continued growth, now is a great time to start collaborating with influencers on Voicy.   

While rates can vary significantly based on the influencer and product being promoted, let‚Äôs take a closer look at how much you can expect to pay to promote your product on Voicy.  

### How Much Do Voicy Influencers Charge in Japan? üí∞ 

Typically, audio influencers on Voicy will charge between 3,000 to 5,000 yen for a 30-second promo.  

This is about $20 to $35 dollars, a relatively inexpensive price for advertising on a platform that has cornered the market on audio content in Japan.  

For 30 seconds of advertising during popular time slots, influencers can charge between 10,000 and 50,000 yen, about $70 to $350 dollars.   

Again, this is a bargain compared to rates for advertising on other media platforms in Japan.  

When it comes to sponsored content, Voicy influencers can charge up to 200,000 yen for a single promo, about $1,400 dollars.  

Although these rates should give you an idea of what you might expect to pay for a promo from a Voicy influencer, the rates can vary significantly based on the influencer and product being promoted.  

**"Rates can change depending on the reach and popularity of the influencer,"** said a recent article by the Japan Times.   

Rates can also vary based on the desired engagement with the influencer.  

For example, are you looking for a one-off promotional announcement, or do you want an influencer to become more closely connected with your brand, such as by becoming an ambassador and promoting your brand regularly?  

While a one-off announcement may only cost you a few thousand yen, a full-fledged ambassador can charge millions of yen.  

### Where to Find Voicy Influencers üîç  

Voicy has its own influencer marketing division that connects brands with influencers on its platform.   

If you don‚Äôt have the time or resources to search for influencers yourself, using Voicy's marketing division puts you in good hands.  

Voicy‚Äôs marketing division has already connected over 200 brands with influencers, and according to its website, **"We will propose the influencer that best matches your product or service."**    

If you want to search for influencers yourself, you can find many influencers showcasing their own Voicy stations on their social media accounts.    

For example, Takehiko Kogure is a former Tokyo Metropolitan Police detective who has gained handsomely from promoting his Voicy station on social media.   

With over 235,000 followers on Instagram, Kogure has 809,000 followers on Voicy, making him one of the most popular influencers on the platform.  

Kogure‚Äôs Voicy account is popular not only with the general public, but also with police officers and local government officials who tune in for daily commentary on crime and public safety.  

Given his large following, Kogure is likely to charge a significant fee for promotions.   

Similarly, Hiroshi Matsumoto is a popular radio personality who has attracted a staggering 1.73 million followers on Voicy.  

Matsumoto also has 726,000 followers on Twitter and 526,000 followers on Instagram.  

With the potential for so many eyes on a brand that Matsumoto promotes, he can charge significant fees for promotions.  

He also has a partnership with the popular television network Fuji TV, increasing his credibility and reach even further.  

### Conclusion üìù   

The voice is the new face of influencer marketing in Japan.  

While promotional posts featuring images of products may catch the eye, it's the sound of a product being promoted that resonates more with consumers.  

What‚Äôs more, as the rise of smart speakers and voice-activated assistants has shown, modern consumers prefer speaking and listening over typing and reading.   

As a result, brands would benefit significantly from investing in audio influencer marketing, particularly in a market like Japan that is leading the way.   

Given the relatively low prices of promotions on Voicy and its growing appeal, now is the time to start collaborating with influencers on Voicy.
