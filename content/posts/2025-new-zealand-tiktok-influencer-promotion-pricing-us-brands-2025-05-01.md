### üèÜ Cost-Effective Influencer Marketing

One of the biggest challenges for brands when it comes to influencer marketing is figuring out how much to pay influencers. 
While larger influencers often have higher pricing, they also have more reach, making it easier for brands to justify spending more money.

However, many brands are unaware that micro-influencers often have higher engagement rates than larger influencers, making them a cost-effective alternative.

Micro-influencers are also seen as more authentic and relatable by their audiences, which can help brands build trust and credibility with potential customers. 
They also tend to have a more niche following, making it easier for brands to target specific audiences.

Despite these advantages, many brands still focus on larger influencers for their campaigns, which is why influencer pricing can vary so much. 

The good news for US brands looking to promote their products in New Zealand is that TikTok influencer marketing is still relatively affordable compared to the United States.
