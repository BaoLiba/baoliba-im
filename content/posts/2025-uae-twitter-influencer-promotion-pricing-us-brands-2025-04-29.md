## ðŸ’¡ 2025 United Arab Emirates Influencer Pricing on X for US Brands

The rise of TikTok and Instagram has left traditional platforms like Facebook in the dust, and X is no exception to this trend. 

The emergence of X has disrupted the influencer economy, and how much you can expect to spend on X influencers in 2025 is no different than how much you expect to spend on TikTok influencers.
