When it comes to influencer marketing, DMM influencers can be considered the best of the best in their space. 

The DMM platform, which caters to a Japanese audience, has various influencers and creators producing high-quality adult content. The platform rivals Japan's other major adult brands, such as Fanza and Niconico, and is a well-established brand in its own right. 

However, many of these DMM influencers aim their performances toward a western audience, particularly Americans. After all, American consumers are known for their high spending on adult content, and Japan is the world's leading producer of adult content.

DMM influencers offer a plethora of unique ways to promote a business or brand, and Americans will find many of them relevant to the needs of their companies. 

So, if you‚Äôre looking to effectively promote your American business to the Japanese market, you'll need an understanding of what DMM influencers require to promote your brand. Let's dive into what you need to know about DMM influencer marketing rates and collaboration options.


## üí∞ How Much DMM Influencers Charge for Promotions

DMM influencer promotion rates can vary greatly. According to Baoliba, many influencers receiving offers from American companies to promote them on their DMM page often ask for nothing less than $1,000, especially if they're already well-known figures.

Some of them can even ask for rates as high as $10,000 for a single promotion. 

But when a DMM influencer is relatively unknown, they can ask from as little as $20 to $50 per promotion. A good portion of the DMM influencers who ask for less than $200 also fall into this category.

From what we've seen, the average rate DMM influencers charge is between $1,000 and $3,500. 


## üìä How DMM Influencer Marketing Compares to America

When we compare rates for other influencers in America, we see that most operators in the DMM sphere are also relatively low compared to American influencers. 

For instance, in America, YouTube influencers charge an average of $5,000 to $10,000, while TikTok influencers charge an average of $8,000 to $15,000. Instagram influencers charge an average of $3,000 to $10,000 depending on their niche.

Thus, American companies looking to go through DMM influencers should see this as a huge cost-saving opportunity. 


## üí° Understanding DMM Influencer Marketing

DMM influencers may not be wearing a suit and tie, but they know how to present your brand to the highest commercial standards. 

A DMM influencer can promote your American brand on their DMM profile in many ways. They can display your logo or branding, mention your brand in a post or video, share your brand on their DMM timeline, and even host contests for their audience with your products as the prize.

This level of promotion can benefit your American brand in many ways. Having your brand associated with some of the best adult talent in the industry will improve its reputation. This is particularly effective with American consumers, as they often perceive Japanese adult content as more professional than what they see in America. 

Also, as seen above, DMM influencers are considerably cheaper than other influencer marketing options available to American brands. 


## üåü Ways to Pay DMM Influencers

DMM influencers primarily accept payments in cryptocurrency or gift cards. 

DMM influencers can also consider alternative payment methods. You may be surprised to know that DMM influencers are open to barter. 

If you have a lucrative, in-demand American product or service you think could benefit them, feel free to pitch it. 


## üè∑Ô∏è Common Gift Cards to Pay DMM Influencers

While many Americans think of brands like Amazon and iTunes when they think of gift cards, DMM influencers may be more interested in adult gif cards. Here are some of the popular adult gift cards Japanese DMM influencers accept. 

-¬†¬†Vanilla Gift Card
-¬†¬†One 4 All Gift Card
-¬†¬†Giftcards.com
¬†¬†
Vanilla and One4All gift cards are popular in America and easy to procure. Just visit any nearby convenience store or pharmacy, and you'll likely find them there. 

However, getting an adult gift card isn't as straightforward, and seeing how DMM influencers are primarily Japanese, you'll want to make sure you get one meaningfully directed toward Japan. 

Here are some brands that offer gift cards usable in Japan:

-¬†¬†Amazon Japan
-¬†¬†G2A
-¬†¬†Fandango Now
-¬†¬†Sakura
¬†¬†
Of course, to procure these cards, you'll have to get them from those specific websites or outlet locations.¬†


## üé´ Understanding DMM Memberships Payment Systems

Many DMM influencers utilize paid DMM accounts to market their videos. 

DMM has a pay-per-view system. Under this system, DMM influencers can charge per video or tier their content. In this tiered model, they can charge a standard fee for basic content and higher fees for premium content.

DMM allows influencers to set their prices for their content, as long as they adhere to DMM guidelines. And DMM influencers can have a variety of content subscription prices.

A DMM video can be as low as ¬•70 (about $0.47) or as high as ¬•50,000 (about $336). 

While DMM influencers can set their pricing, the platform does restrict how it pays them. DMM pays its influencers by commission only, and the commission rate can be as low as 30% and as high as 50%.

While payment options can be limited through DMM accounts, this strategy can have some big payoffs for influencers. Among Japan's adult content platforms, DMM is easily the biggest, boasting over 200,000 creators. 

DMM is recognized as a top-tier brand, and influencers want to work with it. Its popularity allows influencers to attract a wide audience, build their brand, and ultimately make money doing it. 


## üíª Ways DMM Influencers Typically Promote Brands

Many DMM influencers promote brands on the platform through videos. DMM allows its influencers to upload a variety of videos, including short clips, full-length movies, and livestreams.

When promoting a brand, DMM influencers can add the brand logo to their videos during editing. They can integrate the brand into their video content in various ways, such as endorsing it, using it in skits, and even making it the focal point.

Some DMM influencers, such as Akira Takasu, focus primarily on VR videos.  VR videos can allow a DMM influencer to create an experience for their audience. With VR headsets becoming more popular, DMM influencers can create experiences that rival anything you'll find in America.¬†


## üìù DMM Influencers Cover Their Bases

While DMM influencers may promote a brand to the best of their ability, they also protect their own reputation. 

A DMM influencer advertising your American brand will likely require your business to provide them with proof of authenticity. 

This is more so if your brand is an adult product or service. DMM influencers are operating in one of the most regulated industries in many parts of the world. They need to protect their reputation, and they can lose their careers and livelihood if they associate with the wrong brand.


## ‚öñÔ∏è DMM Influencers Must Abide by DMM Guidelines

Just like DMM influencers will want to vet your brand, DMM has strict rules that every DMM influencer must follow. Here are some of the promotional guidelines DMM sets for its influencers.

- Influencers can perform video promotions only if they have the promotional product in hand while shooting.
- DMM influencers can't incorporate other actors in their promotional videos.
- DMM influencers must incorporate the promotional item into the video. 
- They must not mislead consumers regarding the promotional product. For example, if they‚Äôre promoting a food item, they can‚Äôt suggest it's a toy.
- DMM influencers must broadcast the promotional product as it is, including its flaws.
- The promotional item must be the main part of the video. Other content must only be supplementary. 
- The promotional item must be relevant to the content. For example, if the content is about an influencer cooking, they can promote a spatula. However, if they are doing a cooking video, they are not allowed to promote a spatula, sink, and stove all at the same time.
- Any product that violates DMM regulations is not allowed.
¬†
The regulations might seem stringent, but these restrictions can ultimately work in your favor as well. Knowing that DMM influencers operate under strict regulations can give your American brand peace of mind when it comes to vetting your influencer. 


## ‚ùó Risks of Working with DMM Influencers

While DMM influencers can help American brands market to the Japanese audience, brands should remain cautious. 

Here are the main risks American brands face when collaborating with DMM influencers.

- **Authenticity**: DMM influencers can vet your American brand, but they are still only human. If they refuse to promote your brand because they can't verify it, that may be for the best. On the other hand, if they don‚Äôt understand your brand‚Äôs authenticity because it‚Äôs too abstract, they may not be the right influencer either. If they do agree to promote your brand, but they're not convinced it‚Äôs a great fit, they may lack the motivation to put forth their best effort. In the worst-case scenario, they may even misrepresent your brand, which could damage your reputation.
- **Payment Methods**: DMM influencers primarily use cryptocurrency and adult gift cards. While cryptocurrency can offer American brands some anonymity, it can be a risky proposition. Also, cryptocurrency can go up or down significantly based on the market. If your brand invests heavily in that avenue, that avenue may change significantly overnight or even during the course of a promotion. Additionally, as mentioned, while adult gift cards can work with DMM influencers, they have their limitations.¬†
- **Legal Issues**: DMM influencers who promote adult content may be at risk of limited legal recourse in a brand dispute. A DMM influencer promoting an abstract product may misrepresent that product, but what recourse does the American brand have? The first thing they'll want to do is vet their influencer, and if they went through a reputable agency or platform, that agency or platform may service as a bridge to resolve any disputes. However, agencies and platforms may primarily service Asian markets, meaning American brands may have little recourse if they deal with a rogue influencer.¬†
