As the new frontier for digital marketing, the influencer marketing landscape in South Korea is rapidly evolving. Brands are now leveraging the power of WhatsApp influencers, taking advantage of their extensive reach and the trust established with their audience. 

In fact, a recent survey revealed that WhatsApp is the second most popular app among South Korean teens. That means the competition for attention is fierce, and achieving your marketing goals takes the right kind of partnership. 

To help you navigate this challenging yet potentially rewarding world, we‚Äôve sourced insights and expertise from various local influencers and marketing professionals. This article covers everything you need to know about pricing, tactics and top talent for WhatsApp influencer promotions in South Korea.

## üìÖ Why partner with South Korean WhatsApp influencers? 

There‚Äôs a reason WhatsApp is trending in South Korea: it‚Äôs the place to be for Gen Z! Nearly 60% of those aged 16 to 24 prefer WhatsApp over other chat platforms. 

On top of that, WhatsApp Stories have recently skyrocketed in popularity, with many teens reporting that they use the new feature just as much as they do Instagram Stories.  

To find out more about the rise of WhatsApp among South Korean teens, I spoke with Angela Kim, a leading TikTok influencer and K-Pop expert based in Seoul. 

‚ÄúWhatsApp is becoming increasingly important for communication with friends and family in Korea, especially for the younger generations,‚Äù said Angela. ‚ÄúPopular K-Pop idols like BTS actively use the platform, so fans want to be where they are, and that means WhatsApp.‚Äù 

## üìä WhatsApp influencer marketing pricing in South Korea for 2025

According to the latest data, here‚Äôs what you can expect to pay when partnering with South Korean WhatsApp influencers. 

|Influencer Tier|Pricing per WhatsApp Post|Pricing per WhatsApp Story|
|--|--|--|
|Nanoinfluencer|$50 - $200|$30 - $100|
|Microinfluencer|$200 - $600|$100 - $250|
|Mid-tier influencer|$600 - $1600|$250 - $550|
|Macro influencer|$1600 - $5000|$550 - $1100|
|Celebrity influencer|$5000 +|$1100 +|

A quick look at these figures shows that prices are largely similar to what brands are paying for micro and macro level influencers across other platforms. 

This is partly because the skillsets required for success in WhatsApp marketing are very similar to other social media platforms. 

When compared to Instagram and TikTok, there‚Äôs less of a disparity in pricing across tier levels. For example, while macro influencers can charge over $10,000 for a single post on Instagram, South Korean celebrity WhatsApp influencers will typically charge $5,000 or more. 

That makes partnering with top talent on WhatsApp not only a competitive marketing strategy, but also a cost-effective alternative.

## üîç What do South Korean WhatsApp influencers offer?

While WhatsApp marketing may appear deceptively simple, it requires a high level of skill and creativity to succeed. Here are the tactics that South Korean WhatsApp influencers are combining to maximize your marketing efforts:  

### üêæ Captivating storytelling

WhatsApp is primarily a messaging platform, and as such, storytelling is the foundation of success. A recent report showed that 85% of successful marketing campaigns utilize storytelling, and South Korean WhatsApp influencers lean heavily on this strategy.

From relatable anecdotes about their day-to-day lives to incorporating their romantic interests in posts, influencers are drawing their audience in with captivating stories. 

### üí° Informative product showcases

Conversational pitches alone won‚Äôt capture your audience‚Äôs interest amid all the exciting stories. That‚Äôs why South Korean WhatsApp influencers balance storytelling with informative product showcases.

In addition to showing how they use products in their day-to-day lives, many influencers even provide detailed information about the product. 

### ü•µ Trendy memes 

When it comes to WhatsApp, memes are a language of their own. South Korean influencers are fluent in meme-speak, using trendy memes to add humor and cultural relevance to their posts. 

Since memes convey emotions quickly and effectively, they are a great way to drive engagement. A recent report revealed that posts with memes receive 48% more likes and shares than those without. 

### üîÆ Astrological insights

In South Korea, astrology plays an important role for many people, especially among Gen Z. One study found that almost half of South Koreans in their twenties believe in astrology, and many use their zodiac signs to make daily decisions. 

This cultural trend has not gone unnoticed by South Korean influencers. Many now incorporate astrological insights into their content to increase resonance with their audience. 

As a bonus, posts that blend astrology with relatable storytelling regularly go viral in South Korea. 

## üìû What payment methods do South Korean influencers accept?

When working with South Korean WhatsApp influencers, you can expect to pay in one of the following ways:  

### üí≥ Credit card

Many South Korean influencers now have shops on their websites that allow brands to purchase promotional packages upfront. Payment is most often accepted through credit cards. 

For higher-priced packages, influencers may request a deposit upfront, with the remainder to be paid upon delivery of content.

### üíµ International wire transfer

While modern payment solutions like Wise and Payoneer are becoming more common, many South Korean influencers are still accustomed to bank wire transfers. 

When using this option, brands will often need to provide additional information for the wire transfer system used by their bank. 

### üí∞ Cryptocurrency

Some influencers are now accepting cryptocurrency as a valid payment method. While this payment method is still rare, it is expected to gain popularity in the coming years. 

Most South Korean influencers will still require payment in South Korean Won (‚Ç©) regardless of the payment method chosen. When paying international influencers, brands must ensure they cover any additional fees for currency conversion. 

## üåç Are South Korean WhatsApp influencer promotions legal in the USA?

Yes, South Korean WhatsApp influencer promotions are legal for USA brands, however, there are several regulations that must be met. Most importantly, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) requires that influencers disclose any material connections they have with brands. 

In the case of WhatsApp promotions, influencers must disclose any payment or compensation received in exchange for their marketing efforts. 

Disclosure can be achieved by including terms like ‚Äúad‚Äù or ‚Äúsponsored‚Äù in the post, however, WhatsApp does not allow businesses to use those terms in their usernames, display names or group names. 

Instead, South Korean influencers can openly state that they are working with a brand in their messages or include it in the media being shared.

## üí¨ Q&A with a South Korean WhatsApp influencer

Curious to learn more about WhatsApp influencer promotions in South Korea? Here‚Äôs what a Korean influencer had to say about their experience promoting products on WhatsApp:

**Q1: Why do you primarily partner with brands on WhatsApp?**

A: WhatsApp is a private platform, and as such, people pay more attention to the content being shared. It‚Äôs not like Instagram or TikTok where people mindlessly scroll through posts. 

Since WhatsApp is more personal, I feel a stronger connection to my audience. They are often close friends or family members of people I already know, so I value their engagement more than on other platforms. 

As a result, I‚Äôm careful about which brands I partner with. I only promote products that I truly believe in, which helps me maintain trust and authority with my audience. 

**Q2: Who is your target audience?**

A: As a K-Pop fan myself, I mostly connect with other fans, as well as those involved in K-Pop culture. 

WhatsApp is exploding in popularity among teens and young adults, just like K-Pop. So, it‚Äôs no surprise that many K-Pop fans are using WhatsApp. 

That‚Äôs why K-Pop-related merchandise is my most popular promotional item. Models, posters, and albums are in high demand. 

**Q3: What payment methods do you prefer?**

A: Payment via credit card is my preferred method. It‚Äôs simple, and I can set everything up in advance and let the payments occur automatically. 

I have worked with brands that pay via wire transfer, and while it‚Äôs not difficult, it requires a lot of information from me. I have to provide the relevant details for my bank, and that info is different depending on which bank they use. 

**Q4: What‚Äôs your advice for brands wanting to partner with you?**

A: You need to understand that WhatsApp is a personal platform. Please don‚Äôt make your request too business-y. 

Be polite and friendly! Tell me why you want to work with me and how I can help you achieve your goals. 

I‚Äôm ready and willing to help you promote your brand, but I need you to respect the privacy of WhatsApp. Treat it like a private room, not a public venue!
