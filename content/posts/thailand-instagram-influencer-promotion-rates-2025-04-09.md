## üìà Thailand Influencer Marketing Trends for 2025

As of 2023, **Instagram remains the most popular social media platform among Thai teenagers**, with TikTok closely following.

Although TikTok is set to overtake Instagram in popularity among Thai teens by 2025, Instagram is still expected to rank as the number one platform for influencer marketing in Thailand.

### Thailand‚Äôs Changing Landscape

According to a recent report published by the **Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT) Connection Science lab**, Thailand's social media marketing landscape is changing fast.

The report found that **Facebook, Facebook Messenger, and Line are the top three social media platforms** used for marketing in Thailand.

However, surveys show Thailand is poised to see a surge in TikTok usage and marketing over Instagram.

**TikTok Marketing Agency in Thailand** estimates that TikTok will grow to 60 million users in Thailand by 2025.

Meanwhile, **TikTok recently announced** that it is set to launch shopping features across Southeast Asia.


## ü§î Thailand Influencers Are Honest About Their Rates!

Most Thai influencers are open to chatting about their rates and services, and many even publish their media kits online.

For example, **Thai actress and influencer, Cee Cee, posts her media kit on her website**. It includes a detailed breakdown of her services and associated rates.

Cee Cee's media kit is a useful resource for brands looking to send products for reviews, sponsored content, events, and more.


## ü§î Is It Possible to Freeze Your Instagram Account in Thailand?

There are reports of Instagram accounts in Thailand becoming frozen after influencers are accused of not posting enough original content.

In Thailand, where **official media kits** are scarce, brands coming together with influencers may want to draft **service agreements** that outline expectations.

But influencer marketing in Thailand is still a relatively new practice, so there is little precedent for contracts among influencers and brands.

### Best Practices to Protect You and your Influencers

1. Avoid posting trifling, fake, or misleading content.
2. Publish a service agreement that outlines expectations.
3. Clearly define deliverables.
4. Indicate compensation terms.
5. Include a force majeure clause. 


## ü§î Thai Influencer Marketing Regulations

Most influencers across the globe are required to indicate when they are posting sponsored content, and the same is true in Thailand.

Thai influencers should be sure to include **#ad, #sponsored, or #pr** in their post captions to identify sponsored content to their audience. 

While this is an industry best practice, it is also important to note that **the Office of the Consumer Protection Board of Thailand (CPB)** has stated that, as of 2023, Thai influencers are not legally obliged to disclose sponsored content. 

However, **violating the standards of care established by the CPB can lead to civil penalties**.


## ü§î How Long Does a Thailand Influencer Marketing Campaign Last?

A run-of-the-mill Thailand influencer marketing campaign lasts **four to eight weeks**.

During that time period, influencers will create and post sponsored content according to the terms outlined in their service agreement.

### Best Practices

Brands should schedule follow-up meetings with influencers to ensure that deliverables are being met, and they should keep track of analytics through the campaigns. 

Having conversations with influencers can also help uncover insights that can be helpful for future campaigns. 


## üìà Conclusion 

While Thailand influencer marketing is still in its infancy, it is already established as a cost-effective means for American brands to reach their target audience.

However, conducting ample research on potential Thai influencers and their audience demographics is a must.

In an evolving market like Thailand, doing your homework is the best way to get ahead of the curve.
