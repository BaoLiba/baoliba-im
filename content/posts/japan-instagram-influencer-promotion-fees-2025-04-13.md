The prices are based on a survey of a sample of 200 influencers by the marketing agency SIS. 

While these prices can help you understand the market better, there are many factors involved in influencer marketing, and it can be complex. 

Here‚Äôs a detailed guide to how it works for American brands looking to collaborate with Japanese influencers on Instagram.



## üìà Pricing by Instagram Follower Count
