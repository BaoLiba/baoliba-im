As the largest and oldest video sharing site in Japan, NicoNico offers a unique opportunity for influencer marketing campaigns. Unlike its competitors, NicoNico takes pride in its independence and libertarian nature, showcasing creative content that pushes the boundaries of mainstream media.

While the platform does have a significant number of users under 30, it also attracts a much older audience compared to Western sites like TikTok. In fact, the average user is over 20 years old, with nearly 30% of users aged 30-39, and over 20% aged 40-49. This demographic is highly desirable for brands looking to reach a more mature audience in Japan.

But what do you need to know about pricing when it comes to working with NicoNico influencers?

## ðŸŽ³ NicoNico influencers offer multiple types of collaborations

NicoNico influencers typically offer two types of collaborations.

1. **Sponsoring an event or stream:** This is the most common form of influencer marketing on NicoNico. The influencer will host a live stream or event and mention your brand multiple times during the session. Pricing is determined by how many times your brand is mentioned.

2. **On-screen promotions:** If youâ€™re looking to create more permanent ads, NicoNico influencers can place your brand name or products in their videos. These ads will be highlighted on-screen during the video, providing ongoing exposure. Pricing is determined by how long the ad is shown.

Both types of collaborations are extremely effective on the NicoNico platform. In fact, a survey by Banner Bridge found that over 40% of respondents reported that NicoNico influencers provide a high level of brand exposure.

## ðŸ’´ Pricing for NicoNico influencer collaborations

When it comes to pricing, NicoNico influencers tend to charge slightly more than their counterparts on other platforms. A study by the Digital Marketing Institute found that the average cost of working with a NicoNico influencer is $1,600 per collaboration.

**Hereâ€™s a breakdown of typical pricing for different types of collaborations:**

- **NicoNico streams:** $800 to $2,000

- **NicoNico videos:** $900 to $2,500

- **NicoNico events:** $1,200 to $6,000

When it comes to NicoNico influencers, you really do get what you pay for. While itâ€™s fine to work with lower-tier influencers for your brand, you should avoid overly inexpensive influencers on NicoNico. Due to the unique nature of the platform, itâ€™s a common occurrence for cheap influencers to simply sit in front of their computer screens watching something else, rather than actually creating content for their audience. 

## ðŸ“… The timeline for results with NicoNico influencer collaborations

One of the most appealing aspects of NicoNico influencer collaborations is that they typically result in a burst of sales almost immediately. If youâ€™re looking for a fast return on investment, NicoNico influencers are the way to go.

This immediacy is especially important for brands that cater to a younger audience, like clothing and cosmetics. Many of these influencers have solid, repeat customers who trust their opinions.

With that being said, some brands will require more time to see the results from their campaigns. If youâ€™re a B2B company or you typically sell a higher ticket item, expect to wait six months or more before your ROI catches up with your ad spend on NicoNico.

## ðŸ”Œ Payment models for NicoNico influencer collaborations

When it comes to payment methods for NicoNico influencer collaborations, the options are actually quite limited. However, they tend to be very flexible in terms of payment models. 

**The most common payment models for NicoNico influencer collaborations are:**

1. **Flat rate:** The influencer charges a flat fee for the collaboration, regardless of the results.

2. **Pay per result:** This model is almost unheard of on NicoNico, but itâ€™s worth mentioning because it's the most profitable for brands. With this model, the influencer is paid based on the results of the collaboration, such as the number of clicks, conversions, or views.

3. **Barter:** In this model, the influencer receives free products or services in exchange for their promotion.

Because of the limited payment options, itâ€™s always best to pay NicoNico influencers in cash. And as we mentioned before, they strongly prefer to receive their payments in cryptocurrency. 

There are two main reasons for this: 

- **Anonymity:** The vast majority of NicoNico influencers are men. And when it comes to their identities, many of them prefer to keep them a secret. 

- **Fluctuating value of yen:** The Japanese yen is notoriously unstable, and when it comes to the world of crypto, the yen tends to fluctuate even more. Itâ€™s common for Japanese influencers to receive payments in yen but wait weeks or even months to convert those payments into cash. In that time, itâ€™s not unusual for them to lose a lot of money just because of how much the yen has fluctuated. 

## ðŸ”‘ How to find NicoNico influencers to work with

Finding NicoNico influencers to collaborate with is not as easy as it is on other platforms like Instagram and TikTok. Part of this can be attributed to the overwhelming amount of content available on NicoNico.

However, the vast majority of influencers on NicoNico are associated with an agency. As a result, itâ€™s usually best to work with reputable NicoNico influencer marketing agencies to help you find the right influencer for your brand.

Beryl, for instance, is a reputable influencer marketing agency in Japan that specializes in finding NicoNico influencers for brands to collaborate with. 

They have a solid reputation within the industry and have worked with numerous major brands, including:

- **Honda:** Honda has collaborated with Beryl on multiple occasions to promote their latest models using influencers on both NicoNico and YouTube.

- **Seiko:** Beryl connected Seiko with a number of NicoNico influencers who showcased their watches.

- **Reebok:** Beryl helped Reebok reach a younger audience by finding them various influencers on NicoNico to collaborate with.
