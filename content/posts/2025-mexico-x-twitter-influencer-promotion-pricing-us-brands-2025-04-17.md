Forget TikTok, forget Instagram—if you want to achieve any sizable marketing success in Mexico, the only platform that matters is X (formerly known as Twitter).

In fact, a staggering 81% of Mexican internet users aged 15 to 29 years use this platform for news, even surpassing television!

In fact, Mexican influencers charge only an average of 60.54% of what American influencers charge:
