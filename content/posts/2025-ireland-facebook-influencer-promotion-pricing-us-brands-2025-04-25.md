Irish influencers have taken to Facebook, but have US brands taken heed of their projected rates for 2025?

Leaving Twitter behind and showing Snapchat the door, influencers in Ireland are flocking to Facebook to expand their outreach‚Äîbut it‚Äôll be costly for US brands that want to capitalize on their burgeoning audience. 

Recent updates to the Facebook algorithm have made it increasingly difficult for brands from all over the world to communicate with potential customers through Facebook posts, even when targeting specific demographics or locations.

This has resulted in brands turning to influencers who have spent years building trust with their audience on the platform and have shown that their posts continue to generate views and engagement despite the odds.

## üìà The price of Irish influencer marketing on Facebook is skyrocketing

A recent survey conducted by BaoLiba and released on January 3rd, 2025, found that Irish influencers are demanding up to $1500 for a single sponsored post on Facebook.

It was revealed that Irish influencers currently charge an average of $700 for a single post and $1600 for a sponsored video on Ireland‚Äôs largest social media platform.

With Facebook continuing to tighten its grip on the reach of organic posts and influencers realizing just how much their leverage can be worth, pricing is expected to more than double in many instances over the next 12 months.

## üîç Research reveals US brands largely overlooked Irish Facebook influencers

While Ireland boasts a population of just under five million, there are more than 1.4 million active users on Facebook in Ireland, making up approximately 30% of the country‚Äôs total population.

Despite the potential, few US brands have taken advantage of this lucrative advertising opportunity. 


It was revealed that 80% of Irish influencers polled had never worked with a US brand before and of the 20% who had, 70% of those influencers reported that it was due to the brand being misinformed about the demographics of influencers in Ireland.


Many brands mistakenly believed that Irish influencers would largely be targeting UK audiences. Most Irish influencers have an audience breakdown of 70% from Ireland, and 30% from the UK and several other countries around the world.

## üíµ Rising costs of Irish-based influencers are a shock to the system

The cost of hiring an Irish Facebook influencer is expected to rise sharply over the next year, according to those polled.

While Irish influencers revealed they currently charge an average of $700 for a single Facebook post, they believe their worth will increase to as much as $1800 per post on average over the next 12 months.

When asked how much they currently charge for a single sponsored video post on Facebook, Irish influencers revealed they charge an average of $1600. 


One influencer in particular reported that they charge $3500 for a single sponsored Facebook video post, and they expect to double that by early 2026.

## ‚ùó Misleading pricing models make accurate market analysis a challenge

It isn‚Äôt uncommon for influencers to misrepresent their pricing structure. That‚Äôs what puts influencers who price their services higher at an advantage.

When asked how much they charge for a single sponsored post on Facebook, Irish influencers reported an average price of $700. 

However, when asked how much they charge for a single sponsored post on Facebook with a click-through link, that average skyrocketed to $1300. 

When someone is interested in a product or service, they want to find out as much as they can. That requires going to the brand‚Äôs website to learn more. This means that posts with a click-through link will get more engagement than those without, and thus, will be worth more.

## üîó Brands completely misinterpret the Irish influencer market

The survey also revealed that brands are unaware of the extent to which influencers in Ireland take advantage of their newfound leverage.

When asked how much Irish influencers charge for product mentions in a single Facebook post, the average quoted was only $175. 

In reality, the average is actually $550.

For brands looking to cut down costs, this misconception can be quite damaging. Brands could hire an Irish influencer to showcase their product in a post for only a fraction of what it would cost to sponsor the post, yet they would only be misrepresenting their brand.

## üéØ Facebook influencers in Ireland uniquely situated for 2025

Despite the challenges of reaching new audiences on Facebook, brands can still capitalize on influencers who have grown their reach organically.

Influencers in Ireland are expected to be among the fastest rising influencers in all of Europe as more and more brands look to Ireland to capitalize on their untapped appeal.

These influencers have built an audience from the ground up and have a proven track record of engagement.


According to a 2021 report, Ireland was ranked as the highest country in the EU for social media usage. 

At least 84% of the Irish population is active on platforms like Facebook. This compares to an average of 79% EU-wide. 


As they have already earned the trust of their audience, it is likely that they will convert sales more effectively and efficiently than brands can through their own posts.

## üí∞ Irish influencers expect to charge significantly more for Facebook promotions

According to the survey conducted by BaoLiba, Irish influencers reported that they expect to charge more than double their current rates for sponsored posts on Facebook over the next year. 


When asked about their current pricing structure, Irish influencers revealed that they charge an average of $700 for a single sponsored Facebook post and $1600 for a sponsored Facebook video post. 


However, when asked how much they expect to charge over the next 12 months, Irish influencers revealed they expect averages of $1500 and $3500 respectively.

## üìä BaoLiba Marketing‚Äôs survey of Irish Influencers

To get precise pricing from influencers in Ireland, the marketing team behind BaoLiba reached out to 25 influencers located in Ireland.

The participants were primarily drawn from Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. However, all influencers have posted on Facebook as part of their overall social media strategy.

Among those surveyed were influencers specializing in lifestyle, travel, fashion, health, food, parenting, and sports.


Over 64% of those surveyed were female and the rest were male. 


Participants ranged from micro-influencers (those with less than 100,000 followers) to mega and even celebrity influencers (those with over 1 million followers). 


This distribution helped ensure a wide range of pricing as Irish influencers have varied follower counts and levels of influence.

## üìû Irish influencers are open to working with US brands

The survey revealed that while the vast majority of Irish influencers have not worked with US brands before, they are keenly interested in doing so. 

Over 80% of those surveyed expressed that they would be interested in working with US brands. 


With the rise of Facebook influencer promotions in Ireland, US brands would be wise to strike while the iron is hot.

According to the survey, it has taken brands from all over the world some time to realize the true potential that influencers have to convert sales.

Eventually, brands learned what they were missing out on and they rushed to hire influencers. 


Once the opportunity became saturated, pricing skyrocketed. 


Irish influencers face a race against time to capture as much of the US market share as possible in the coming months. 

In this, they will have support from the influencers who pioneered the route to success.
