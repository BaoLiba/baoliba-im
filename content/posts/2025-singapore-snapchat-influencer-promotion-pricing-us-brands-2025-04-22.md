In the crowded digital ad landscape, marketers continually seek an edge to help their brands cut through the noise.

The dual-pronged approach of tapping into influencers‚Äô organic reach and the explosive growth of Snapchat‚Äôs global audience makes Snapchat influencer marketing a compelling avenue for advertising.

With this in mind, if you are a US marketer interested in promoting your product through Snapchat influencers in Singapore in 2025, you‚Äôve come to the right place! 

We will explain what makes Snapchat the ideal promotional channel in Singapore, and provide you with the pricing information you need to prepare your budget for 2025.


## üìà Why Snapchat Influencers are Especially Effective in Singapore

Singapore is a tiny city-state with a population close to 6 million. Although living space is limited, with a total land area of just 728.6 km¬≤ (281.3 sq mi), Singapore boasts a stunning 91% internet penetration rate.

Consequently, Singapore has embraced rapid growth in social media, with 84% of Singaporeans (that‚Äôs 5 million people) claiming to use social media. Additionally, 82% of Singaporeans regularly engage with social media.

Yet despite this high engagement, the average Singaporean spends just 1 hour and 6 minutes daily on social media. For comparison, the average American spends over 2 hours a day on social media!


### üìä Singaporeans Prefer Short-Form Content

This lower engagement time is likely attributable to the fact that Singaporeans favor short, snackable content over long-form media. 

And Snapchat is the ideal platform for short-form content.

Accordingly, Snapchat has emerged as the most popular social media platform among Singaporeans. Over 3 million Singaporeans (that‚Äôs 1 in 6) are Snapchat users, accounting for 65% of their total social media engagement.

With such impressive engagement numbers, it‚Äôs easy to see why Snapchat is a go-to mainstay for Singaporeans.


### üòç Singaporeans Love Being Influenced!

In Singapore, social media influencers have become a social norm. According to a 2023 survey by influencer marketing platform Dovetale, Singaporeans are the second most influenced nationality globally, trailing only the Dutch. 

Moreover, Singaporeans will follow an average of 10.8 influencers in 2024, while 41% of Singaporeans say they are more comfortable being influenced than ever before.

Additionally, 51% of Singaporeans say they will follow more influencers in 2024, while 64% have indicated they have purchased a product that an influencer has promoted in the past.

These statistics all point to the fact that Singaporeans are eager and open to influencer marketing. 


### üëç The Snapchat Generation Loves the Snap Methodology

You may be wondering why Singaporeans favor Snapchat influencers over those on other platforms? 

The reason is that Snapchat influencers may be the most genuine across any social media channel. 

Unlike other social media platforms, Snapchat employs a decentralized influencer model. This means that top-tier Snapchat influencers don‚Äôt have to go through an agency to promote brands.

Instead, Snapchat influencers can create their own brands and physical or digital storefronts directly within the Snapchat app using Snapchat‚Äôs in-built tools.

This creates a very personalized promotion experience, where the influencer interacts directly with their followers and customers. 


### ü§ù US Brands Have Trusted the Snap Methodology for Years

As a result of Snapchat‚Äôs decentralized influencer model, US brands have been creating enduring and meaningful relationships with Snapchat influencers for years.

And it‚Äôs no wonder why; Snapchat is easily one of the most lucrative social media platforms for brands looking to tap into the Singaporean market.

Not only is Snapchat the most popular platform among Singaporeans, but Snapchat users also spend more than 30% more time engaging with branded content than users of other platforms.

This is why brands like Nike and Louis Vuitton have been using Snapchat influencers in Singapore for years.

If you‚Äôre a US brand looking to engage with Singaporean consumers, you will find that partnering with Snapchat influencers is the best way to do so.


## üí∏ What Will it Cost to Promote Your Brand Through Singapore Snapchat Influencers in 2025?

Partnering with a Snapchat influencer can help you rapidly expand your brand visibility in Singapore, but how much will it cost you to do so?

According to studies conducted by influencer marketing company HypeAuditor, prices for Snapchat influencer promotions in Singapore will be approximately as follows:

- **For Snapchat influencers with 1,000‚Äì9,999 followers:** Costs will be around $101.50‚Äì$231.00 per post.
- **For Snapchat influencers with 10,000‚Äì99,999 followers:** Costs will be around $231.00‚Äì$1,085.00 per post.
- **For Snapchat influencers with over 100,000 followers:** Costs will be upwards of $1,085.00 per post.

It‚Äôs important to keep in mind that these prices are estimates as of 2023 and are likely to increase by 2025 as influencer marketing continues to surge.


### üìå These Prices Are Just Estimates; Influencer Reputation Will Affect Actual Costs

While these prices may help you realistically plan your 2025 budget, influencer pricing tends to fluctuate based on several factors.

The first, and most important, is the influencer‚Äôs stature as a known authority on Snapchat. 

If you‚Äôre looking to partner with a well-respected influencer who has a track record of producing quality promotions that consistently deliver results, expect to pay a premium.

Conversely, if you‚Äôre willing to accept a less-known influencer who is still trying to build a reputation, you can likely find a good deal.


### üéØ Influence Comes at a Price

Another factor that affects influencer pricing is the type of promotional content you require from the influencer. 

If you want a Snapchat influencer to purely post about your brand, expect to pay less. 

However, if you want a more involved promotion, such as a product review or an unboxing video, you will pay more. 

What‚Äôs more, if you require quality content that features high production values, expect to pay even more.

Influencer marketing is not a cheap endeavor, but it can yield great returns for brands that do it right.


### ü™ô You Should Expect to Pay More than Other Platforms

Lastly, Snapchat influencer pricing tends to be higher than influencer pricing on other platforms. 

This is because Snapchat, while still a popular platform, has a relatively smaller user base than other platforms such as TikTok or Instagram.

As a result, Snapchat influencers tend to attract a more affluent audience, which is preferable for brands looking to advertise premium products.

Additionally, because Snapchat employs a decentralized influencer marketing model, influencers tend to have a deeper relationship with their followers. This allows them to promote brands more effectively than influencers on other platforms.

This unique quality of Snapchat influencers makes them worth the price, especially for luxury brands. 


## ü§î Choosing the Right Snapchat Influencer for Your Brand

While we‚Äôve covered how much it may cost to partner with Snapchat influencers in Singapore, how can you be sure you are choosing the right one?

According to a 2023 survey conducted by influencer marketing platform Dovetale, 68% of marketers say building relationships with influencers is one of their biggest challenges.

However, building a good relationship with the right influencer is the key to a successful campaign. 

Here are a few tips for choosing the right influencer for your brand.


### üé• Video Content is Key

If you want to connect with the Snapchat generation, one thing is certain; you need to create video content. 

This is due to the fact that video content is much more persuasive than text alone, especially when it comes to influencer marketing.

Snapchat influencer marketing is all about video. So if you want to create an effective campaign, make sure the influencer you choose specializes in video content.


### üè∑Ô∏è Pick Influencers with a Niche Audience

When selecting the right Snapchat influencer for your brand, it‚Äôs important to look for influencers who have a niche audience.

That‚Äôs because niche audiences are generally more engaged in comparison to followers of a generalist influencer.

According to a survey by HypeAuditor, 66% of marketers say engagement is the most important metric when evaluating an influencer.

By using a niche influencer, you‚Äôll likely gain access to a more engaged audience, which can help improve your campaign performance.


### üöÄ Go for Micro or Nano Influencers

Another way to ensure you are partnering with the right Snapchat influencer is to use either a micro or a nano influencer. 

Micro influencers typically have between 1,000 and 100,000 followers, while nano influencers have between 1,000 and 10,000 followers. 

Both types of influencers tend to have a more engaged audience, which can help improve your campaign performance.

What‚Äôs more, micro and nano influencers have lower fees than their larger counterparts. So not only will you gain access to an engaged audience, but you may also be able to save money as well.


### ‚öñÔ∏è Consider Working with an Agency

If you have limited resources, consider using an influencer marketing agency.

While you will pay an agency fee, using an agency can save you time and effort, allowing you to focus on your core business functions.

There are many influencer marketing agencies that specialize in Snapchat influencer marketing. Look for ones that have experience in your product category for the best results.
