## üìä Portuguese Influencer Promotion Pricing on Snapchat for 2025

If you‚Äôre looking for Portuguese influencer pricing, you‚Äôve come to the right place! Here‚Äôs a table outlining the predicted costs for Snapchat influencer promotions in Portugal:



| Promotion Type                     | Pricing (US Dollars)    | 
| -----------------------------------| ----------------------- |
| Snapchat Stories                   | $60                     |
| Snapchat Filters                   | $280                    |
| Custom Lens for Snapchat           | $800                    |
| 24-hour Snapchat Story Highlights  | $1,200                  |
| Snapchat Ads                       | $3,000                  |
| 2-week Snapchat Ads                | $5,000                  |
| 1-month Snapchat Ads               | $10,000                 | 


### Snapchat Filters

The most affordable option for influencer promotions on Snapchat in Portugal is to have the influencer create a custom filter. Add a filter to your Snapchat campaign to attract more of the Portuguese market! 

Standard filters are automatically added to the Snap Map. However, if you're using a community geofilter, you will need to send in your geolocation files so Snapchat can see the exact location where you want to apply the filter.

### Custom Lens

For a little over twice the cost of a Snapchat filter, you can have a Portuguese influencer create a custom lens for your brand. 

Just like filters, lenses can be seen on the Snap Map and can also be presented in the chat list. A brand can pay for the lenses to be kept active and available to the community for a longer period of time.

### Snapchat Ads

The most expensive strategy for Portuguese influencer promotions on Snapchat is to run ads. Lastly, there's the option of hiring a Portuguese influencer to promote a Snapchat ad campaign using their own account. 

The influencer can create an ad for your product themselves, or simply post a sponsored clip about how followers can find the ad. 

One catch with Snapchat ads is that they are based on a bidding system. This means that you could end up paying a lot more than you originally anticipated. 


## ü§î Why Are Portuguese Influencers So Much Cheaper than American Influencers?

In 2025, American influencers are projected to charge at least 2 to 3 times more than their Portuguese counterparts. 

This is likely due to the difference in the average cost of living between the two countries. The table below shows how Portugal compares to the USA in terms of the average cost of living:



|  Cost of Living Index     |  Portugal |  USA     |  
| -------------------------| -------- | ------- |   
|  Grocery Index           |  83.29   |  100    |
|  Restaurant Index        |  72.53   |  100    |
|  Housing Index           |  62.18   |  100    |
|  Transportation Index    |  67.51   |  100    |
|  Healthcare Index        |  91.99   |  100    |
|  Utility Index           |  78.41   |  100    |
|  Overall Index           |  65.36   |  100    |  


### Cost of Living Index

As you can see from the table above, Portugal‚Äôs overall cost of living index is 65.36, while the USA has an index of 100. 

This means that Portugal is over 34% cheaper than the USA in terms of what it costs to live in that country. As a result, Portuguese influencers can charge significantly less for their services.
