## üé§ Why Work with Thai TrueID Influencers?

Most marketing experts agree that influencer marketing relies heavily on *word-of-mouth* marketing. Since consumers tend to trust their peers more than they do brands, partnering with a popular local influencer can lead to a more robust marketing strategy than traditional paid advertising methods.

But, there are several other reasons why you may want to cooperate with a TrueID influencer over creators from other platforms:

1. **Community-oriented branding:** Influencers on TrueID often have established communities around the content they post. This makes it easier for brands to engage with a wider audience while simultaneously fostering lasting relationships within the community.
  
2. **Familiarity with TrueID's unique features:** TrueID has unique features like sharing stories to help users discover new content. This capability allows influencers on the platform to tailor their marketing efforts according to the specific type of content they produce.

3. **Growth of the platform:** Since its launch in 2016, TrueID has seen incredible growth, with over **20 million** installs and **700 million** users. By partnering with TrueID influencers, brands can benefit from this growth while establishing their presence in the market.


## ‚úÖ How Brands Can Cooperate with TrueID Influencers?

Brands looking for collaboration opportunities with Thai TrueID influencers can explore several avenues:

1. **Direct Outreach:** Brand managers can directly get in touch with influencers by sending them direct messages and/or commenting on their posts. The influencer's bio may also have third-party links that redirect users to their official websites or other platforms where inquiry forms can be filled out.

2. **Influencer Marketing Platforms:** Brands can also join influencer marketing platforms like **BaoLiba** to connect with TrueID influencers looking for paid creative opportunities. Unlike direct outreach, these platforms handle most of the inquiries, allowing for a streamlined process.

These agencies are powerful allies, as they have close relationships with the influencers and can help negotiate collaboration deals. They also handle most of the inquiries and often provide post-collaboration reports, showcasing the influencer's performance for the brand.

## ‚ùó Risks when Working with TrueID Influencers

As with any influencer marketing campaign, there are risks involved as well.

### 1. Authenticity of Influencers

There have been unproven allegations against Thai influencers regarding their authenticity and reach. Claims of inflated follower counts or fake engagement rates are just some of the issues that can plague any influencer marketing campaign. 

Brands are encouraged to conduct their due diligence before making any collaboration deals.

### 2. Thai Advertising Laws

While influencer marketing can be an effective way to promote a product or service, it is important to note that it is still subject to the same advertising laws as traditional forms of marketing.

In 2018, the Thai Food and Drug Administration (TFDA) imposed rules on the endorsement of food, drugs, cosmetics, and medical supplies. This was followed by an announcement in April 2022, mandating that influencers must also obtain licenses from the TFDA before endorsing any products under their jurisdiction.

As a best practice, brands should ensure their influencer partnerships comply with Thai laws.

### 3. Scope of Campaigns

TrueID influencers often require multiple posts and/or streams to effectively market a brand. Brands that fail to deliver adequate briefs may suffer from poor campaign quality and influencer performance. 

Brands are therefore encouraged to provide clear and comprehensive briefs to their chosen influencers.
