Zalo is the underdog of social media platforms but is incredibly popular in Vietnam. It's packed with features, privacy, and ease of use, and it's now gaining traction in the USA. Companies looking to target Vietnam for marketing, especially ads, are jumping on board, as seen with large companies like Samsung.

Part of this plan includes influencer marketing. Brands looking to collaborate with Zalo influencers need to know how much they will pay and how much Zalo influencers expect to earn.

## üë§ Who are Zalo Influencers?

A Zalo influencer is someone with a sizable following on the social media app Zalo who regularly posts content like blogs, reviews, or other types of media. Their audience relies on them for information they can trust to make purchasing decisions.

There are a few ways to categorize Zalo influencers, so brands can choose the best fit for their needs.

### üé§ Types of Zalo Influencers
 
- **Nano**: less than 1,000 followers
- **Micro**: 1,000 to 10,000 followers
- **Mid-tier**: 10,000 to 100,000 followers
- **Macro**: 100,000 to 1 million followers
- **Mega**: 1 million or more followers

Each category of influencer has its own strengths and weaknesses, and this can affect both pricing and the potential ROI. 

## üí≠ Pricing for Zalo Influencers

The cost for Zalo influencer marketing varies a lot, but brands can typically expect to pay between ***$20 to $100*** per post.

### üí∞ Factors Influencing Zalo Influencer Pricing 

**1. The number of followers**

It's common for Zalo influencers to charge a price in the range of ***$0.01 to $0.25*** for every follower they have.

For example, Zalo influencers with:

- 1,000 followers - $10 to $30
- 10,000 followers - $100 to $250
- 50,000 followers - $800 to $1,250
- 100,000 followers - $1,500 to $2,500

This is just a ballpark figure. Those with less than 1,000 followers may charge a little more since brands want the added popularity of influencer marketing but lack the budget for larger accounts.

**2. The engagement rate**

The engagement rate is the average number of likes and comments the influencer can expect to receive per post. This can significantly impact pricing since a high engagement rate means more interaction and conversation with potential customers.

Influencers with a high engagement rate will charge proportionately more. For example, an influencer with 10,000 followers and 100 likes and 20 comments per post will charge more than someone in the same follower category with only 10 likes and one comment. 

Here is a basic range:

- low engagement (0.01 to 1 percent): no increase
- medium engagement (1 to 3 percent): +10%
- high engagement (3 to 5 percent): +20%
- very high engagement (5 to 10 percent): +30%
- ultra engagement (more than 10 percent): +50%

**3. The length of the post**

Having a longer blog or review takes more effort, and this effort is rewarded with higher earnings. Many Zalo influencers specialize in long-form authentic content, so brands can see a strong return on their investment.

- Short post (less than 400 words): no increase
- Medium-length post (400 to 800 words): +10%
- Long post (800 to 1,200 words): +20%
- Very long post (more than 1,200 words): +30%

**4. The complexity of the content**

The more complex the content, the higher the price. An influencer who can do a video will charge more than just a post. Here is a breakdown:

- Blog post: base price
- Blog post with photos: +10%
- Blog post with video: +25%
- Video only: +40%

**5. Promotion of the post**

If the influencer promotes the post to get more eyes on it, they will typically charge more. 

- Organic: no increase
- Boost on Zalo: +20%
- Promotion on other social media: +25%

## üõí How Zalo Influencers Are Paid

Paying Zalo influencers is pretty straightforward since many of them work through agencies. However, if a brand is working directly with an influencer, they need to know how to pay them, which is usually done in VND (Vietnam Dong).

Here are several ways USA brands can pay Zalo influencers:

1. **Bank Transfer**: Wire transfers from the USA to Vietnam can be complex. Traditional banks might charge hefty fees and take several days to process. A more dependable option is working with money transfer services that specialize in international payments. These services often provide competitive rates and faster processing times than traditional banks. Examples include:

- **PayPal**: The influencer needs to set up a PayPal account. Once they send their PayPal email address, you can send the payment from your account to theirs. PayPal may charge a small fee.
- **Wise**: Wise specializes in international payments, and the influencer will need to set up an account. You can then send money directly to their Wise account using your credit card or bank transfer.
- **Western Union**: Influencers can pick up cash, or you can send the payment to their bank account. They create an account using their bank information, and you send money easily.

2. **Check sent by mail**: Checks can be mailed internationally, but the influencer will need to deposit it in their Vietnamese bank account, which may take longer and incur fees. 

3. **Crypto**: If the influencer accepts it, brands can send them payment in bitcoin, Ethereum, or other crypto. Crypto transactions tend to be faster and cheaper than other methods, but both parties will need a digital wallet to complete the transaction. 

4. **Escrow services**: To limit fraud, some brands may choose to use an escrow service. This is especially true with large payments. 

Once the influencer has received the payment, they will create and post the agreed-upon content. They might tag the brand profile, use special links, or hashtags to track traffic to the brand website or landing page.

## üìù Conclusion

While Zalo influencer marketing is new to many brands in the USA, it offers great opportunities. The pricing is a fraction of what they are used to with other platforms, and the potential to tap into the lucrative Vietnamese market is worth it.

Getting started is easy by searching for Zalo influencers on the various influencer platforms that specialize in connecting marketers with influencers.
