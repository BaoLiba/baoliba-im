| Influencer Type | Followers | Price per Single TikTok Video (USD) | Notes                     |
|-----------------|-----------|------------------------------------|---------------------------|

**Note:** Pricing usually covers a single TikTok video or a short series (e.g., 2-3 posts). Some influencers charge extra for livestreams or complex edits.

### Pricing Factors US Brands Should Know

- **Engagement Over Followers:** Vietnamese TikTokers with smaller but highly engaged audiences can be more bang for your buck than big follower counts with low interaction.
- **Content Ownership:** Some creators charge more if the brand wants full content rights to repurpose posts elsewhere.
- **Bundled Deals:** US brands often negotiate bundles ‚Äî a few videos + TikTok livestream + Instagram cross-posts ‚Äî for better rates.
- **Trend Riding:** If a creator can hop on a viral trend fast, expect a premium since timing is crucial.

## üí° Payment Practices & Legal Tips for US Brands Working with Vietnamese TikTok Influencers

### Payment Methods & Currency

Payments usually go through bank transfers in USD or Vietnamese Dong (VND). Popular platforms:

- **PayPal:** Widely accepted but expect ~4-6% fees.
- **Wire Transfer (SWIFT):** Common for larger deals, but watch out for bank fees and slower processing.
- **Wise (formerly TransferWise):** Growing in popularity for cheaper international transfers.

Most Vietnamese TikTokers prefer USD payments due to currency stability, but some accept VND if the brand has local operations.

### Legal & Contractual Pointers

- Draft clear contracts in English and Vietnamese to avoid misunderstandings. BaoLiba often recommends bilingual contracts.
- Include content deliverables, deadlines, payment terms, content rights, and confidentiality.
- Watch out for Vietnam‚Äôs advertising rules: influencer content must disclose paid promotion clearly, or you risk fines.
- Intellectual Property: Specify who owns the content after posting to avoid future disputes.
- US brands should consult with local legal advisors or rely on platforms like BaoLiba for compliant influencer deals.
