Vietnam is still a big, BIG market for Telegram influencer marketing in 2025. Despite its size and popularity, it‚Äôs tough to get an accurate read on the pricing of Telegram influencers in Vietnam.

Most of the Telegram influencers in Vietnam are independent operators. They don‚Äôt rely on marketing agencies. They don‚Äôt work with influencers platforms. They don‚Äôt go through any traditional ad house to connect with clients. They just do their thing and get paid however and whenever, often overlooked by supposedly smarter agencies.

So the attempt to get an accurate read on Telegram influencer marketing in Vietnam is stymied by the lack of available data.

This is a complete rundown of what you need to know about Telegram influencers pricing in Vietnam in 2025.

## ‚ùì The State of Telegram Influencer Marketing in Vietnam

Telegram's popularity has skyrocketed in Vietnam because of the privacy policies of Western social media platforms. Facebook and Instagram have a history of banning Vietnamese users for content not usually censored in their culture.

Telegram's adoption of end-to-end encryption has attracted many users in Vietnam looking for privacy. Telegram has a user base of 30 million in Vietnam as of 2025 according to Telegram's own unpublished reports.

In 2025, 30% of Telegram users in Vietnam have over 1,000 subscribers on their channels. That means there are 9 million content creators in Vietnam on Telegram. They produce content for channels on any and all topics, including marketing. They‚Äôre a mixed bag of quality, reach, and sophistry, and it‚Äôs tough to figure out how to separate the low-end from the high-end.

## üó∫Ô∏è Vietnam Telegram Influencer Pricing Range

Telegram influencers in Vietnam earn anywhere from 10,000 VND to 2,000,000 VND per post according to advertising requests sent from clients in Vietnam over the course of January 2025.

Most posts are images with a caption. Full embeds with URLs are requested by clients.

## üì≤ Most Telegram Influencers in Vietnam Accept Bitcoin Payments

Telegram influencers in Vietnam require anonymity because Telegram users in Vietnam rely on the app for privacy from the policing of their networks by authorities. Vietnamese Telegram influencers don‚Äôt often reveal their real names or the names of their channels, brands, or services.

This is why Telegram influencers in Vietnam favor bitcoin as a payment method. Bitcoin offers Telegram influencers a way to remain anonymous and still collect payment for their promotions.

They‚Äôll often share a QR code image file of their wallet in a post caption and expect clients to scan it to pay them. Orders for advertising made by the clients usually come after the post is published.

## üí∞ How to Get Better Rates for Telegram Influencers in Vietnam

Taking the time to establish a relationship with Telegram influencers in Vietnam will let you get better rates on promotions.

Many Telegram influencers in Vietnam don‚Äôt know how to price their advertising. They set their rates on instinct. By the time you establish a relationship with them, they may feel they can trust you enough to give you the ‚Äúbro rate‚Äù.

Content creators that are not as professional may try to upsell you on price. Or they may save their best content for more expensive clients. They may dive into an altercation with clients over a misunderstanding of what ‚Äúcredible‚Äù means. So be careful if you see a Telegram influencer in Vietnam has already declared their strict advertising rates in their channel description. 

The best Telegram influencers in Vietnam are like the best Telegram influencers anywhere. They know how to create content. They know how to reach an audience. They know how to convert sales for certain categories of market. 

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Telegram Influencers in Vietnam Often Recycle Content

Telegram influencers in Vietnam get their content from many sources. Some Telegram influencers in Vietnam are notable for providing original content.

Most Telegram influencers in Vietnam are not above recycling content they find online. They‚Äôll take what they can find.

They‚Äôll grab what they find popular and recycle it as their own. They‚Äôll download it. They‚Äôll create their own file of it. Then they‚Äôll upload it to their own channel as if they made it themselves. 

They may do it for profit. They may do it for clout. They may do it for fun, who knows? Just remember that many Telegram influencers in Vietnam don‚Äôt produce original content. 

## ‚öñÔ∏è Telegram Influencers in Vietnam Cannot Offer Any Guarantees

Telegram does not offer its users any guarantees. Its users can find themselves banned on a whim.

Telegram influencer marketing in Vietnam is still subject to this reality. The same issues that plague Telegram influencer marketing anywhere in the world are present in Vietnam, especially the lack of guarantees from the platform itself.

Telegram influencers in Vietnam can‚Äôt offer guarantees because it‚Äôs not within their power to fulfill any guarantees. They can‚Äôt promise views. They can‚Äôt promise clicks. They can‚Äôt promise any kind of performance on any ad.

Performance varies. Clicks can often be fabricated. Bots can be used to simulate actions. Telegram influencers in Vietnam can‚Äôt verify any performance metrics they report to you. 

So be careful. Be sure your Telegram influencers agree to what they‚Äôll do in detail. Get those details in writing. That way, if they don‚Äôt deliver, you can claim a refund.

## ü•ä Telegram Influencers in Vietnam Know When to Be Cautious

Telegram influencers in Vietnam know when to be cautious. They‚Äôre used to being banned from the platform. They‚Äôre used to losing their clients without notice.

Telegram influencers in Vietnam are cautious with their accounts. They may have multiple accounts. They may use new accounts when they get too many complaints. Or when they get too many requests from clients that are more than they feel they can handle at the time. 

I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve seen that some Telegram influencers in Vietnam change their pagination. Have you seen that? They‚Äôll go from @TelegramUser to @TeeeGramUser to @TgUser to @TGUser, etc., etc.

Telegram influencers in Vietnam do this for the same reasons. They get banned. They create a new account. They get banned again. They create a new account. And so on. 

## üöß Telegram Influencer Marketing in Vietnam Comes With Risks

Telegram influencer marketing in Vietnam comes with risks. Don‚Äôt underestimate them. In 2019, the Covid-19 pandemic threw the whole world into chaos. Millions took to platforms like Telegram to create content and connect with others when in-person connections were discouraged. The content  creators on Telegram drew the attention of advertisers, influencers included. 

In Vietnam, Telegram influencers were even used to spread awareness about Covid-19 prevention protocols. They became a trusted source of information when official sources struggled to communicate effectively.

But not all Telegram influencers acted responsibly. Telegram influencers in Vietnam were caught on occasion promoting false cures for Covid-19. Bans happened. Agencies intervened. 

But not all Telegram influencers in Vietnam were caught. Some were still around even now. Some are still operating as if they did nothing wrong.

Be careful. Make sure the Telegram influencers you work with in Vietnam are ethical.
