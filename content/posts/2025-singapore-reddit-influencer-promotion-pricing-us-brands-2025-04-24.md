With the meteoric rise of online influencer marketing, the trend is rapidly being adopted by marketers from around the globe.

This is especially true for Reddit, the world‚Äôs largest discussion platform, with a net worth of $15 billion. It is increasingly being utilized by social media influencers to promote various products and services, as users flock to the platform to discuss current events and share their opinions.

Marketers from the United States are no exception.

In 2025, these influential Redditors in Singapore will begin charging US brands higher rates for promotional posts, revealing how much American businesses can expect to spend on influencer marketing in Singapore.


## üí∞ New Zealand and Singapore Prices Will Spike

A Freelance Marketing Consultant at IRL Marketing, located in Auckland, New Zealand, stated, ‚ÄúThe costs for Reddit influencer marketing in New Zealand and Singapore will likely spike in 2025. Prices are set to increase by 50% as brand demand surges, while influencer competition pushes rates higher.‚Äù

Marketers from the United States looking to promote products and services in Singapore via Reddit influencers should expect to pay higher rates than those that currently exist in 2024.


## üí∏ Current Reddit Influencer Pricing

Currently, rates for Reddit influencer marketing fluctuate dramatically depending on the influencer's popularity and reach.

As of 2024, the average Redditor with a following of 10,000 or less can charge approximately $5 to $15 per post. Rates for Reddit users with a following of 20,000 or more jump to $20 to $40 per post.

However, some influencers do charge as much as $150 and $300 for promotional posts.

Generally, Redditors with a much larger following can charge more, further establishing the price range at which US brands can expect to spend on marketing campaigns in Singapore.


## üåç Facebook Dominates Singaporean Online Influencers

As of 2025, Singaporean influencers using Facebook will be the largest group in Singapore, accounting for 27% of the total influencer population. This will be followed by Instagram at 22%, LinkedIn at 19%, TikTok at 18%, YouTube at 9%, and finally, Reddit, which will account for just 5% of all influencers in Singapore.

Facebook is projected to have the largest share of 28% of total social media influencers in Singapore for marketing campaigns in 2024 and 2025.

Marketing via Facebook influencers is the most prevalent strategy for marketers in Singapore, and a large majority of them opt for this method to promote products and services on social media.

## üó£Ô∏è Reddiquette and Cultural Nuances

Americans looking to market their products and services through Singaporean Redditors must understand the cultural nuances unique to marketing in Singapore. 

They must also become acquainted with Reddit's "Reddiquette." This community guideline outlines what can and cannot be done on the platform.

For instance, Redditors are expected to be courteous to one another and avoid personal attacks. They should also engage in discussions in a meaningful manner and refrain from repeatedly posting the same content.

Redditors also prefer to realize the authenticity behind the products and services they purchase, so they will not promote any company that they think is scamming them.

Therefore, marketers from the USA must establish credibility by gathering as much information about Reddit influencers as possible.

Ensuring that Singaporean Reddit influencers have an established reputation is crucial, as they will be instrumental in building credibility for a US brand in Singapore. 


## ü§ù Strategies to Consider

The following strategies are essential for effectively marketing a product or service in Singapore via subreddit influencers:

1. **Focus on Quality vs. Quantity**: As mentioned above, the number of followers a Redditor has is not the only metric that brands should pay attention to. The level of engagement is another important factor. Therefore, US brands should analyze the level of interaction their posts receive. In addition, brands need to ensure that their Reddit influencers have a good reputation within the community. Users can upvote or downvote a comment, which reveals an influencer's overall credibility. 

2. **Establish Clear Communication**: Open communication is vital when it comes to formulating a promotional strategy with Reddit influencers. Marketers from the USA need to ensure that they relay their vision accurately while remaining open to any suggestions that subredditors may have. It is also important to ensure that the timeline for the partnership is clearly communicated. 

3. **Create an Effective Promotion**: Given that Redditors have unique motivational drivers than conventional influencers, US brands must tailor their promotions to align with these differences. For instance, unlike Facebook and Instagram influencers, Reddit influencers do not earn commissions on sales. Instead, they earn money through fixed fees or signing bonuses from brands. This will determine how each influencer approaches promoting a product or service. 

4. **Monitor Effectiveness**: Marketers in the USA need to analyze how effective their promotional strategy was in regards to their goals. This involves collecting and interpreting data on the performance of a particular post. Brands can also solicit feedback from the Reddit influencers they partnered with to gauge how effective the collaboration was.
