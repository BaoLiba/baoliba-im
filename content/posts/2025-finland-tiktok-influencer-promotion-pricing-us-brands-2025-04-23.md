The world of influencer marketing is always changing, especially when it comes to pricing. What might have been a good deal yesterday could easily be a complete rip-off tomorrow.

Because of this, we compiled a list of the expected price points for TikTok promotions with influencers in Finland for American brands in 2025. 

Let's get right into it.

## ‚ùì How Much Do Influencers Get Paid in Finland?

The average Finnish TikTok influencer who has 100,000 followers charges 758‚Ç¨ for sponsored posts in 2025, while influencers with more than 1 million followers charge 4,187‚Ç¨, according to recent research from the Finnish influencer pricing platform NoTox.

The following table illustrates the average 2025 pricing expectations for TikTok promotions from Finnish influencers based on follower counts.  

| Follower Count | Average Price  |
|----------------|-----------------|
| 10,000         | ‚Ç¨103            |
| 50,000         | ‚Ç¨377            |
| 100,000        | ‚Ç¨758            |
| 250,000        | ‚Ç¨1,470          |
| 500,000          | ‚Ç¨2,737         |
| 1,000,000      | ‚Ç¨4,187          |

It is important to note that there are many variables that will affect these price points. As with most things in business, you often get what you pay for. 

The more followers a TikTok influencer has, the more experience they will have building their audience and knowing how to achieve great engagement. 

Additionally, influencers who have found a niche and followed it consistently will likely have an audience that is more relevant to brands who require that niche.

## üì¢ When Pricing Influencers, What Else Should Brands Consider? 

When negotiating pricing with influencers, it should be kept in mind that followers do not equal engagement. Often, influencers with a high follower count will not have good engagement rates because they did not build their audiences authentically.

According to a 2024 report by HypeAuditor, TikTok has the lowest engagement rates of any platform. They noted that, ‚ÄúTikTok influencer engagement rates have plummeted from 18% in 2022 to just 4.4% in 2024‚Äù.

What influencer pricing platforms do to compensate for this is list influencers by their average engagement rates. 

NoTox offers the chart below as a reference for pricing influencers based on engagement rates.

|----------------|----------------------|-------------------|

These influencers charge between 1,000‚Ç¨ and 1,200‚Ç¨, which is far less than influencers with 1 million followers and a 2%-3% engagement rate who charge 3,000‚Ç¨.

## ‚ùó Tips for American Brands Looking to Work with TikTok Influencers in Finland

While Finland is known for its high educational standards, evidence shows that the worldview of its citizens is far more limited than that of many other nations.

The infographic below shows that when it comes to their understanding of other cultures, they are bottom of the pack.

![Finns Are The Least Culturally Aware](https://myojobcenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Finland-Final-Image.png)

A lack of cultural awareness can be a double-edged sword. The good news is that it may be easier for Americans to introduce trends to the Finnish populace. The downside is that they might also miss the mark.

Getting to know an influencer's audience is important for every brand, but especially so when there's a language and cultural barrier involved. 

Ensure that you don't waste money on an influencer marketing campaign that misses the bullseye by a mile. 

Engage with Finnish influencers who have a reputation for taking the time to get to know their audience. 

This will ensure that the voice and persona they present in videos resonates well with both their audience and yours. 

Additionally, it will help you avoid the embarrassment of coming off as culturally insensitive.
