Marketing on social media platforms such as Twitter can appear straightforward, but Japanese Twitter influencers have unique pricing standards for promotion. Why is that?

In contrast to the West, many people in Japan regard social media influencers and those who gain significant followings on social media platforms not as social media celebrities, but as respected members of society, similar to television personalities.

This cultural phenomenon leads to many people in Japan becoming Twitter influencers. Even if influencer marketing is not a lucrative venture for them, it is simply something they do on the side for fun or as a hobby.

Thus, while many Twitter influencers in Japan do not require a large amount of money for promotions, the ones that do charge at a much higher price than influencers in the West, especially when you consider the average salary in Japan.

Keep reading for a breakdown of how much Japanese Twitter influencers charge for promotions, how they set their rates, and everything you need to know about this unique market.

## üìä Influencer marketing in Japan

Japan ranks as the third-largest advertising market in the world, spending over $39 billion annually.

While influencer marketing on traditional platforms such as television remains popular, social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok are becoming increasingly utilized.

In fact, social media influencer marketing is projected to reach $4 billion in Japan by 2025, making it one of the largest influencer marketing sectors in the world.

The report states that the growing popularity of social media influencers is largely driven by the younger generation.

This demographic prefers to watch video content over static media such as banners, ads, or posters. Moreover, they are skeptical of traditional advertising and place their trust in social media influencers, who they feel communicate more authentic viewpoints.

## ‚ùó Difference in influencer marketing in Japan

Despite its growth, the influencer marketing landscape in Japan remains very different from that of the West.

Unlike in the West, social media influencers in Japan are often not regarded as social media celebrities. Instead, they are viewed more as authorities or experts in their fields, similar to television personalities.

Many in Japan regard social media influencers with admiration and a sense of awe. This creates a layer of earnestness and authenticity to their branding, along with an air of respectability and professionalism.

Thus, Japanese Twitter influencers, along with influencers on other platforms, often have much higher standards for their branding, content creation methods, and promotion rates.

## üí° How much do Japanese Twitter influencers charge?

While a Twitter influencer in the United States might charge somewhere around $1,000 for a promotion, many influencers in Japan charge a much higher rate.

Because of the cultural phenomenon mentioned above, many Japanese Twitter influencers charge between ¬•100,000 to ¬•500,000 ($780 to $3,900) per promotion, and some high-profile influencers can charge ¬•1,000,000 ($7,850) or more.

While the influencer marketing industry continues to grow in Japan, many influencers are still motivated by sincerity and authenticity. This can lead them to charge lower rates than they could achieve, making influencer marketing more accessible.

Still, the average promotion rate for influencers in Japan is much higher than in the West, as influencers dedicate a significant amount of time, energy, and resources to create profit-worthy content.

### ‚úÖ Average prices of promotions on Twitter in Japan

While some Japanese Twitter influencers may charge significantly less for their promotions, the average prices range as follows:

- **1 Tweet:** ¬•13,000 to 30,000 ($100 to 240)
- **1 Tweet + 1 Image:** ¬•30,000 to 50,000 ($240 to 390)
- **1 Tweet + 1 Video:** ¬•50,000 to 100,000 ($390 to 780)

Of course, these prices depend on the influencer‚Äôs follower count, engagement rate, and other important marketing metrics.

## ‚ùì Why are influencer rates higher in Japan?

Despite higher averages, many Japanese Twitter influencers charge less than their American counterparts. This is especially true for influencers with fewer followers.

For instance, influencers in Japan with somewhere around 10,000 followers may only charge ¬•50,000 ($390) or less for a promotion.

However, influencers with larger followings may charge much more. In fact, Japanese Twitter influencers can charge more than traditional media advertising costs.

On average, a 30-second television advertisement can cost as much as ¬•70 million ($546,000) to produce. For a similar reach, a Japanese Twitter influencer could charge approximately ¬•500,000 ($3,900).

### ‚úÖ How to find Japanese Twitter influencers

While the cost of marketing with Twitter influencers in Japan is higher than in the West, the rates are still reasonable compared to the cost of traditional media.

Furthermore, unlike television advertisements, Twitter influencer promotions can reach niche audiences and deliver valuable engagement. Twitter promotions are also easier to measure in terms of cost-effectiveness.¬†

Despite this, major international brands in Japan are still often unable to find influencers that match their campaign requirements. It can also be difficult to check influencers‚Äô marketing metrics or analyze their performance.

Fortunately, this can all be avoided by partnering with a reputable influencer marketing agency. These agencies, such as **BaoLiba**, can connect brands with trustworthy influencers based on the campaign‚Äôs needs, goals, and requirements.

In addition, influencer marketing agencies have the experience and expertise to measure marketing metrics and analyze campaigns for optimal performance. They also take care of things like contracts and payments.

## üì¢ Regulations for influencer marketing in Japan

Furthermore, many brands are also concerned about the rules and regulations regarding influencer marketing in Japan. For instance, **the Act Against Unjustifiable Premiums and Misleading Representations** regulates advertising in Japan.

This law requires influencers to indicate that their posts are advertisements by using specific terms. This applies to any posts created in exchange for money, goods, or services.

Also, Japan‚Äôs **ASCI Code of Ethics** requires posts to be clearly identified as advertisements. Influencers usually do this by saying ‚ÄúÂÆ£‰ºù,‚Äù which means ‚Äúadvertisement.‚Äù This is usually placed at the top of the post.

In addition, Japanese Twitter influencers usually attach a URL link to their profiles. This link may lead to a website that further explains the benefits of the product or service being promoted.

However, many influencers only use the first method, and they do not use URL links.

While international brands are often concerned about these regulations, influencer marketing agencies know how to navigate these waters, which can help brands avoid penalties or fines.

## üí° Conclusion

In short, many influencers in Japan have much higher rates than influencers in the West. While they may be slightly more difficult to find, reputable Japanese Twitter influencers can provide brands with unique and serious marketing opportunities.

Whether you are a Japanese brand looking to expand your social media presence or an international brand looking to enter the lucrative Japanese market, influencer marketing can provide you with a solution.
