When considering how much to pay Instagram influencers in Chile, it's easy to make assumptions. With the rise of influencer marketing worldwide, a lot of brands may think that prices correlate almost directly to how many followers an influencer has. This, however, is not the case, as many factors contribute to how Chilean influencers set their rates. 

If you're a USA-based brand looking to work with Chilean influencers in 2025, we have laid out what you can expect to pay in the South American nation.


## üìä What is influencer marketing pricing in Chile like in 2025?

As Chile is geographically removed from the USA, it is common for many brands to feel that influencer pricing for posts would be substantially lower than in their home market.

In fact, while influencer marketing in Chile may be a bit less expensive than in the USA, the prices influencers set in 2025 will not be significantly lower than American pricing. 

It can be expected that influencer prices in Chile will continue to rise for two primary reasons. The first is that influencer marketing is trending upward in Chile as it has elsewhere globally. The second reason is that in recent years, Chile has experienced harsh inflation, which has contributed to raising prices in all sectors (including influencer marketing).


## üíµ How much do influencers in Chile charge in 2025?

In 2025, a USA brand can expect to pay around $150 for a sponsored Instagram post from a Chilean influencer with a following of approximately 10,000 people. 

This amount increases steadily as follower counts rise. For instance, influencers with around 50,000 followers will likely charge about $300, while influencers with 100,000 followers will charge around $500. 

Those influencers with 500,000 followers can expect to charge around $800, while the top tier of influencers with 1 million followers is likely to charge around $1,200 per post.
 

## üìà What is the average income for influencers in Chile?

The average yearly income for influencers in Chile is reported to be around $18,000, which equates to about $1,500 per month. 
It is worth noting that many influencers do not have the title of ‚Äúinfluencer‚Äù as their primary income-generating endeavor. Many influencers have other jobs or side jobs that generate additional income alongside their influencer duties. 
As has been reported regarding the influencer economy, there are many more aspiring influencers than recognized or verified influencers. Therefore, there are a lot of influencers who won't see a dime for their marketing efforts.

## ‚ò† What is the average engagement rate for Chilean influencers?

As Spanish-speaking influencers, it is common for many Chilean influencers to be lumped together as ‚ÄúLatino‚Äù influencers. Thus, it is possible to take a look at Latino influencer engagement rates as an indicator of Chilean influencer engagement rates.

Reportedly, Latino influencers have an average engagement rate of 2.88 percent on their Instagram posts, which is lower than the global average of 3.50 percent.

It‚Äôs also worth noting that many influencers have switching mechanisms that inflate their engagement metrics. For instance, it has been noted that influencers often trade likes or engagement with one another, and brands are encouraged to watch for these types of manipulations when working with influencers.


## üéØ How do influencers in Chile get paid?

As is typical globally, Chilean influencers can be paid in a number of ways. Here are some of the most common methods in which influencers in Chile receive payments:

### Direct transfers 
This is one of the most common ways in which influencers are paid for their marketing services. The influencer simply provides the brand with their bank account details, and the funds are deposited directly into their account. This method is also often the fastest way for Chilean influencers to receive payment. 

### PayPal 
Due to the nature of influencer marketing, it is common for Chilean influencers to work with brands located around the world. As such, global payment platforms like PayPal make it easy for brands to pay influencers more efficiently than bank transfers.

### Cryptocurrency 
Paying influencers in cryptocurrency is an up-and-coming method of payment. Some Chilean influencers have seen the benefits of being paid with digital currency and are actively pursuing these payments. 

### Free products or services 
Often US-based brands may not have the budget to pay for an influencer's post, especially if they are just starting out. If this is the case, a brand can approach a Chilean influencer and offer them free products or services in exchange for a post or two on their Instagram page. 


## ü§ë Why do influencer prices vary?

As stated, there is a wide range of prices that Chilean influencers charge, largely based on their follower counts. However, follower count is far from the only factor that contributes to Chilean influencer pricing. Here are some of the other factors to consider that help determine influencer pricing in Chile:

### Content type 
If an influencer charges $500 for a static post, they may charge $1,000 for a video post. This is because video posts require more effort and time to create than static posts. 

### Deliverables 
In addition to different content types, influencers may charge different amounts depending on the total deliverables they are providing. An influencer may charge $500 for one static post, while offering two static posts and one story post for $1,000. This means that a brand should clarify exactly what deliverables are being agreed upon when working with Chilean influencers.

### Niche 
As a rule of thumb, influencers in specialized niches usually charge more than influencers in general niches. For instance, if a brand is looking to work with a Chilean influencer in the medical niche, they should expect to pay significantly more than if they work with someone in the lifestyle niche.

### Audience engagement 
Chilean influencers who have highly engaged audiences often charge more than influencers who do not enjoy similar audience participation. 

### Experience 
Chilean influencers who have been in the game longer and have more experience will charge higher prices than newer influencers who lack this experience. 


## üí° Tips for working with Chilean influencers

If you're a USA brand looking to work with Chilean influencers and you want to do it right, consider following these tips:

### Avoid scams 
As with all influencer marketing, there are scam Chilean influencers looking to take a brand's money and run. When looking for influencers to work with, always do your due diligence. Look for reviews from past brands they‚Äôve worked with and watch out if they have a large pool of followers but little to show in terms of engagement. 

### Be specific 
When conducting outreach for influencer marketing campaigns, brands should take care to be specific in their communications. This includes being clear about what the deliverables will be and detailing how the influencer is expected to perform or present the product or service.

### Objectively evaluate influencers 
When brands evaluate influencers for potential partnerships, they can follow a simple checklist to objectively evaluate influencers. This checklist can include items such as the influencer‚Äôs engagement rate, authenticity score, and audience demographics. 


## üßê Do Chilean influencers need an RUT to work with brands?

Yes, Chilean influencers must obtain a RUT (Rol √önico Tributario) if they are working with brands and being paid for their services. 

The RUT is a national identification number and a registry number is used for tax purposes in Chile. The numbering system complies with the Chilean government's classification of people and legal entities such as businesses, corporations, and organizations. 

Chilean influencers fall under the ‚Äúindividuals‚Äù category and must utilize their RUT number as part of their tax reporting process. 

Obtaining a RUT is a straightforward process for influencers. They can schedule their appointment with the Chilean tax office online and complete the required forms. The tax office will provide the influencer with a temporary RUT, and the official RUT will be sent in the mail afterward. 

Additionally, there is no cost associated with obtaining a RUT. 


## üîë Key takeaways

If you're a USA brand looking to work with Chilean influencers in 2025, you can expect to pay anywhere from around $150 to $1,200 for posts on Instagram. 

The influencer economy is strong in Chile, and as such, prices are not much lower than in the USA. Chilean influencer prices will continue to rise as inflation continues to increase in the nation and as influencer marketing trends grow in Chile.
