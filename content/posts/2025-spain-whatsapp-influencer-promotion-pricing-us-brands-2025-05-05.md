Pricing is always the hot topic. In 2025, WhatsApp influencer promotion costs in Spain have become more standardized but still vary a lot depending on influencer size, engagement rate, and campaign scope.

### Small Micro-Influencers (1K-10K followers)

### Top-Level Influencers (50K+ followers)

Big names can ask for **‚Ç¨3,000-‚Ç¨10,000** ($3,300-$11,000 USD). These are rare, high-profile influencers who can give your brand national exposure. They often offer comprehensive packages that include multiple touchpoints ‚Äî voice notes, personalized videos, and even exclusive group chats.

**Note:** Expect some influencers to charge based on performance or deliverables rather than flat rates. Payment methods usually include bank transfer, PayPal, or local payment platforms like Bizum.
