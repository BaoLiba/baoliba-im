When it comes to pricing for YouTube influencers in Ireland, American brands must prepare for a wide range of rates and costs. 

With Ireland's growing reputation as a leader in influencer marketing, American brands looking to hire Irish influencers on YouTube need to be aware of the costs they can expect to pay in 2025.

Moreover, those generally unfamiliar with how influencer promotions work may be quite surprised by just how much influencers in Ireland typically charge for promotional services on YouTube.

In this article, we‚Äôll take a look at what American brands can expect to pay for influencer marketing on YouTube in Ireland in 2025.


## üí∏ What Influencers in Ireland Charge for YouTube Promotions

As a general rule, influencers in Ireland tend to charge between $1,000 and $20,000 for promotional services on YouTube in 2025. 

Although prices can and do fluctuate depending on a variety of factors, American brands can expect to pay an average of about $6,000 to $7,000 to hire a typical Irish YouTube influencer for a promotional video of their product or service in 2025.

### üí∞ Low-End Rates

On the lower end of the spectrum, American brands can expect to pay anywhere from about $1,000 to $4,000 to hire Irish influencers with smaller followings, or those just starting out in the influencer industry. 

Although they may not have as big of an audience as larger influencers, these emerging influencers can still be effective in marketing products or services to their audience. 

### ‚öñÔ∏è High-End Rates

On the higher end, high profile Irish influencers with millions of subscribers can charge anywhere from about $10,000 to $20,000 or even more for promotional services on YouTube in 2025. 

These influencers typically charge a premium for their services, but can often deliver an extensive reach with their promotions, increasing the chances of attracting more customers. 

### üìâ Influencer Markups

It is important to note that many Irish influencers may charge American brands a markup for promotions. Markups typically occur when an influencer works through an agency or marketing platform. 

Although it‚Äôs generally still cheaper to hire Irish influencers rather than influencers in the US, American brands should always take markups into account when budgeting for influencer marketing campaigns in Ireland. 


## üìä Influencer Marketing Trends in Ireland

In recent years, influencer marketing in Ireland has seen significant growth and evolution, with trends indicating a rising popularity of video content, especially on platforms like YouTube. 

### ü§≥ Video Content Dominating 

Irish influencers are increasingly adapting their strategies by focusing on promoting video content through their channels.

A survey conducted by the Irish influencer marketing agency, BOLDR, found that 36 percent of influencers in Ireland plan on creating more video content in 2024. 

With YouTube being the leading platform for video content, YouTube influencers in Ireland will most likely be a major part of video marketing strategies for Irish influencers.

### üß≠ YouTube Growth

According to BOLDR‚Äôs survey, YouTube is consistently reported as the second most popular influencer marketing platform in Ireland, with 38 percent of influencers reporting they promote on the platform. 

Additionally, more than half of influencers in Ireland plan to invest more time on YouTube in 2024.

The survey states, ‚ÄúWhile Instagram has dominated influencer marketing for a long time, it seems that Irish influencers are finally seeing the potential of YouTube.‚Äù

One of the main reasons for this shift is YouTube‚Äôs "longer shelf life" compared to other platforms. 

### üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è More Authenticity

Irish consumers are now demanding more authenticity from influencers for the products they promote. 

According to a recent survey by the influencer marketing platform, Oozle Media, consumers globally prefer influencer marketing strategies that are more realistic and relatable. 

While influencers demonstrating products in a realistic setting was the most favored strategy, the second most popular was influencers making ‚Äúmessy‚Äù or "mistake" videos of them trying to use a product. 

### üõçÔ∏è Brands Taking Over 

While influencers in Ireland have been seen as the ones promoting brands, a recent trend has marketers seeing the potential of using influencers to promote their own brands as well. 

According to BOLDR‚Äôs survey, 45% of Irish influencers say they would love to develop their own brand. Brands that have already established themselves in the market are the most likely to adopt this trend.

Brands that have already established themselves in the Irish market will likely be able to capitalize on this trend by using their own influencers to promote a wider portfolio of products.

### üîÆ 2025 Predictions 

Predictions indicate that influencer marketing in Ireland will continue to grow, especially in the video content space. 

The Irish influencer marketing platform, BOLDR, predicts that 2025 will see a rise in live shopping, more video content and ‚Äútry before you buy‚Äù influencer strategies. 

According to BOLDR, ‚ÄúLive shopping events are becoming huge in markets like Asia and we predict that Irish influencers will start to host these events in 2025, especially on platforms like YouTube.‚Äù

## üíµ Payment Methods

When hiring Irish influencers for promotions on YouTube, American brands can expect to use a variety of payment methods. 

### üí≥ Credit Cards

Using credit cards is one of the most common payment methods for influencer marketing deals in Ireland. Credit cards enable brands to quickly and easily make payments to influencers after a promotional deal has been fulfilled.

### üè¶ Bank Transfers

Another common payment method is bank transfers. Brands often use bank transfers when hiring influencers directly rather than through an agency or marketing platform.

Bank transfers can take a little longer than credit card payments but are generally quite secure.

### üí∞ PayPal

PayPal is another popular payment method for influencer promotions in Ireland. PayPal is particularly useful for international transactions, making it a go-to payment method for American brands hiring influencers in Ireland.

### üíµ Escrow Services

For larger payments, brands may want to consider using an escrow service like Upwork. Escrow services add an extra layer of security for both parties, ensuring that the influencer gets paid only after the promotional deal has been completed to the brand's satisfaction.

### üé¨ Influencers as Services

Lastly, brands can also use influencer marketing platforms like BaoLiba to hire influencers for promotional services. 

Platforms like BaoLiba typically include a feature that allows brands to pay directly for influencer services, giving brands peace of mind knowing that their payment will only go to the influencer once their promotional deal has been fulfilled.
