If you think Tumblr is dead, you might be surprised to learn that in 2023, it has 545 million active blog accounts and 331 million monthly users.

You might also be surprised to learn that many of those active users reside in South Korea.

In fact, South Korea ranks fifth in Tumblr's distribution of users by country. According to MarketResearch.com, they are the second largest per capita users of Tumblr in the world.

Booming 'K-Tumblr' Scene

Unlike other social networks that are banned in China, Tumblr is not blocked. In fact, the second largest group of Tumblr users by country is China.  

This means the people of East Asia who are keenly aware of the latest trends often use Tumblr as a primary venue to showcase their content. 

People making the content that ends up on Tumblr are referred to as influencers. In Korea, they are often referred to as Tumblr stars, and these content creators often have millions of followers.

This creates the perfect environment for trendsetting, allowing East Asian users to be some of the quickest to catch up with global trends. 

If you are trying to market your product or brand in South Korea or China, K-Tumblr stars can be an effective way to do just that.

K-Tumblr Influencer Marketing 

Korean Tumblr is a vibrant ecosystem complete with popular blogs, fandom art, and meme culture. 

But using K-Tumblr influencers for your marketing campaign is not as simple as DMing an influencer and asking them how much they charge. 

You first need to know the pricing expectations of Korean Tumblr influencers if you want to get the best bang for your buck.

K-Tumblr Influencer Pricing 

The average rate for a K-Tumblr influencer promotion ranges between $50 and $500. 

A handful of K-Tumblr influencers with high visibility can charge between $1,000 and $5,000 for a promotional post. 

Those prices also depend on the type of promotional messaging you are looking for. A simple link posted to a bio or added to a blog won't cost nearly as much as a full blog post or meme creation.

For example, K-Tumblr influencer and meme maker Kwon Eunbi charges $50 for a link in the bio of her blog. But her customized meme responses to questions submitted to her ask section costs $10 each.

On the other hand, K-Tumblr influencer and artist Dall-e Kawaii charges up to $5,000 for a fully customized illustration of your brand or vision.

Payment Methods

When it comes to payment methods, Korean Tumblr influencers usually prefer PayPal. 

Some K-Tumblr influencers may also request payment through Venmo. 

Cash App is less common, but some will accept it.

In South Korea, bank transfers would be considered an uncommon payment method for influencer promotions. 

While direct bank transfers are common for personal transactions between friends, they are generally avoided for business transactions when possible.

Korean Kakaotalk Bank 

This is where Kakaotalk comes into play for influencers looking to promote products and brands. 

Kakaotalk is a widely-used messaging app in South Korea similar to WhatsApp.

It is also an all-in-one platform that combines social media, e-commerce, and banking.  

This means many small business owners in South Korea use Kakaotalk as their primary hub for conducting business.

Kakaotalk bank allows users to send money to each other in a matter of seconds. So many K-Tumblr influencers prefer to get paid through this method instead of traditional banking methods.

In fact, Kakaotalk Bank has garnered 40 million users and over $55 billion in deposits since launching in 2017. 

Western Union is still a well-known service, so a few K-Tumblr influencers may also accept payment through it as well.

K-Tumblr Collaboration Contracts 

When it comes time to negotiate the pricing for a promotional post, Korean Tumblr influencers may ask for a contract.

Contracts are not as common in the K-Tumblr influencer marketing scene compared to influencer marketing on other platforms like YouTube and Instagram. 

This is largely due to the informality of Tumblr as a platform.

However, certain influential K-Tumblr figures that have experience working with brands may request a contract be signed.

K-Tumblr collaboration contracts are typically created by the influencer themselves or a representative if they have or are seeking an agent. 

A K-Tumblr influencer collaboration contract may include stipulations for content production, review periods, payment methods, and timelines, among other things.

Despite the informality of Tumblr, contracts protect both parties in a sponsored promotion and should be honored.

Korean Tumblr Influencer Marketing Agencies 

Korean Tumblr influencers may have experience working with brands and may even have formal business training. 

But they are content creators first, and many do not have the time or resources to manage their own marketing campaigns. 

This is where K-Tumblr influencer marketing agencies come into play. 

K-Tumblr influencer marketing agencies help brands identify the right K-Tumblr influencers for their marketing objectives.

Agencies also tend to have firsthand knowledge of Korean Tumblr influencers pricing expectations. This makes K-Tumblr influencer marketing agencies an invaluable resource for brands looking to promote their products on Tumblr.

Some popular K-Tumblr influencer marketing agencies include Natta Yam and Baoliba. 

Baoliba is a global KOL marketing platform currently offering services in over 100 countries, including Korea. Baoliba has established partnerships with reliable Korean Tumblr influencers to help facilitate promotional campaigns for brands looking to target East and Southeast Asia.
