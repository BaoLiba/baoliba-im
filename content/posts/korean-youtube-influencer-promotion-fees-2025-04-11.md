The above figures have been extrapolated from a comprehensive report detailing the average rates Korean influencers charged in 2022, according to a 2023 study published by Hoobin Star.


### ü§î K-YouTube Marketing Trends

Despite the broader consensus that TikTok is the preferred social media application for Generation Z, the data shows Korean influencers are still charging more to promote brands on YouTube than TikTok, as previously shown.

Furthermore, 64% of YouTube users in Korea are aged 18 to 24 and actively engage with content on YouTube and social media, with 56% spending three hours or more on the platform daily.

This puts young YouTube influencers at a distinct advantage in the growing market, as they are more relevant and relatable to the demographic that brands wish to target.

### ‚Ç©160.41 Million USD generated by Korean Influencers through YouTube Marketing

In 2022, Korean influencers garnered ‚Ç©215 billion KRW ($160.41 million USD) in revenue through YouTube marketing in Korea. 

While Korean influencers primarily conduct brand promotions in Korea, many are also featured in campaigns for international brands, such as Sony, Gucci, Dior, Samsung, Fendi, Prada and even Beats by Dre.

According to a report published by the Korea Creative Content Agency (KOCCA), YouTube is the most important channel for influencers marketing in Korea.

Ninety-two percent of marketers in Korea regard YouTube as the most important platform for influencer marketing, with 85% rating it as effective, according to a 2022 survey conducted by the Korea Creative Content Agency (KOCCA).

In fact, the Korean influencer marketing industry is expected to maintain a compound annual growth rate of 27.6% between 2022 and 2026.

This growth is attributed to YouTube‚Äôs continued popularity over other social media platforms, despite the meteoric rise of TikTok in the West.

The increased growth of the Korean influencer marketing industry is indicative of the growing power and influence influencers yield over their audiences in Korea.

### K-Influencer Pricing Models

Korean social media influencers utilize a range of pricing models when charging brands for promotions.

While most Korean influencers will prefer to charge brands a flat rate for sponsored collaborations, some influencers will negotiate commission based payment models.

Here is a comprehensive breakdown of the most common pricing models currently utilized in Kinfluence:


#### 1. Flat Rate Sponsored Collaboration

The most common method Korean influencers charge brands for sponsored collaborations is through a flat rate fee.

A flat rate fee is charged regardless of sales generated. This pricing model is particularly popular with larger influencers who have a devoted following that will engage with their promotions, regardless of the influencer's affiliate status.



#### 2. Commission Based Pricing Model

For Korean influencers who have smaller followings, it is common to agree on commission based pricing models when working with brands.

In a commission based pricing model, the influencer usually charges a nominal flat rate fee for their services, in addition to receiving a percentage of sales generated through their marketing efforts.

The nominal fee could typically range between 50,000 KRW to 300,000 KRW ($43 to $255 USD) depending on the influencer's follower count and engagement.

The commission percentage will vary by influencer, but it usually ranges from 5% to 20%, with the standard being around 10-15%, depending on the influencer's niche.



#### 3. Pay per Click Pricing Model

While less common than the flat rate and commission based pricing models, some Korean YouTube influencers will charge brands a nominal fee based on the number of clicks generated through their promotions.

For example, an influencer may charge a brand $1 USD per click, with a minimum charge of $300 USD for 300 clicks if the influencer fails to generate that many clicks.

This pricing model can be especially beneficial for bloggers or influencers whose primary influence comes from their ability to drive traffic to a particular site.

#### 4. Pay per Action Pricing Model

In addition to charging based on clicks, Korean influencers will sometimes charge brands a nominal fee based on a particular action taken by a user or viewer in response to the influencer's advertisement.

For instance, an influencer may charge a brand $3 USD for every user that signs up for a newsletter through the influencer's advertisement. 

Like the pay per click pricing model, this arrangement can be especially lucrative for bloggers and influencers whose primary strength is driving traffic and action.
