While some people may argue that Tumblr is outdated, the fact remains that it is still a powerful platform for many niche audiences.

For instance, Vietnamese Tumblr influencers can help brands connect with audiences that might otherwise be hard to reach.

But how much do Vietnamese Tumblr influencers charge for collaborations? Spoiler alert: they tend to be very cheap.

If you are a US-based marketer looking to create buzz among the Vietnamese youth, you can skip all the boring market research and jump straight to the collaboration.

This guide will unpack the cost of working with Vietnamese Tumblr influencers in 2025.

## ü§ë Vietnamese Tumblr Influencers Are Dirt Cheap

You could easily secure a sponsored post from a Vietnamese Tumblr influencer for under $15.

In fact, the lowest rates seem to hover between $5 and $10.

This means that a modest budget could get you several posts and even more reblogs.

What makes this possible is the fact that most Vietnamese Tumblr influencers charge in their local currency ‚Äì the Vietnamese Dong.

According to current exchange rates, $1 is equivalent to approximately 23,000 VND.

Therefore, if a Vietnamese influencer charges $15 for a collaboration, this amounts to approximately 345,000 VND.

The average Vietnamese professional earns about 3,500,000 VND monthly, which means the price is still relatively cheap.

## üí∏ PayPal Is the Best Payment Method

Vietnam may be a fast-developing country in Southeast Asia, but its payment infrastructure is still surprisingly outdated.

Many influencers still rely on cash to settle their transactions.

However, most influencers will be able to receive your money via PayPal.

This is especially true for those that have participated in international collaborations before.

To wire them cash, simply ask for their PayPal address and follow the prompts.

It‚Äôs advisable to leave a note stating that the payment is for a collaboration to prevent any misunderstandings.

## üìÖ Vietnamese Tumblr Influencers Are On-Call 24/7

One thing that may shock some marketers is the fact that you may not need to book your collaboration ahead of time.

In fact, many Vietnamese influencers will be able to deliver your sponsored post almost immediately.

This is especially true for those unfamiliar with marketing who may not understand the value of a little suspense.

But even experienced influencers will be eager to promote your brand as soon as they receive your money.

In Vietnam, people still rely on cash transactions and may never have to wait several days to receive payment.

Therefore, they may not have the patience to keep you waiting for your posts.

## üîÖ Don‚Äôt Expect Too Much Traffic

While a cheap price tag sounds enticing, it should not be taken at face value.

Unlike on Instagram or TikTok, Tumblr has no inbuilt growth mechanisms that help your post reach a wider audience.

This is especially true for sponsored posts, which many users naturally avoid.

Therefore, expect only a handful of users to see your ad even if you are working with a high-end influencer.

For example, if an influencer has 10,000 followers, you can expect only a small fraction of their audience to see your post.

And if you are lucky enough to get more traffic, understand that most of that traffic will be fake.

The majority of followers on Tumblr are bots looking to promote the influencer‚Äôs blog.

## üìä Data-Driven Campaigns

If you want to secure a decent ROI, you can‚Äôt simply look at the influencer‚Äôs follower count.

Instead, it‚Äôs best to first study the analytics of your posts to see if there is any interest in the influencer‚Äôs audience.

For example, you can look at how many reblogs or likes you received or how many people clicked on your link.

If the numbers are high, you can then explore how to expand your collaboration.

For example, you can encourage the influencer to create a thread around your product or service.

## üß≠ Finding Vietnamese Tumblr Influencers

When looking for Vietnamese Tumblr influencers to work with, you can use a free social media search engine like Buzzsumo.

Simply search for ‚ÄòVietnam‚Äô and ‚ÄòTumblr‚Äô to find a range of influencers on the platform.

After that, you can reach out to them via the contact details listed on their blog.

## ‚ùó Dangerous Content

Finally, if you want to engage Vietnamese Tumblr influencers, you have to be prepared for anything.

For example, many influencer blogs will contain NSFW content that may shock or outright disgust you.

Furthermore, even if the influencer does not usually post offensive content, they may do so in your sponsored post.

In Asia in general, many young people do not understand the concept of a brand ambassador.

Therefore, they will feel free to express themselves without thinking about the potential risks to your brand.

It‚Äôs important to discuss the terms of the collaboration before wiring them cash.

## ü§° Wrap Up

There you have it folks. Vietnamese Tumblr influencers are highly affordable and always available.

However, be prepared for anything in case they decide to go rogue in your sponsored post!
