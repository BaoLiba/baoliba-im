It seems that the "American dream" of becoming an influencer is not just limited to TikTok and YouTube anymore. Chinese video-sharing platform Bilibili is quickly becoming the rising star of influencer marketing, and with it comes the opportunity for American brands to reach this lucrative market.

For those unfamiliar, Bilibili is a Chinese video platform that boasts its fair share of influencers. The app is primarily used by China's Generation Z, who view it as a cultural staple. It offers similar content to platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Twitch. This means Bilibili influencers are highly prized, as they can offer brands the same benefits found on the most popular Western platforms and more.

So if you're trying to reach this growing market through Bilibili but don't know what you can expect to pay an influencer for their services, this article will break down Bilibili influencer pricing, including what affects their fees and average costs.

## üìà Pricing Structure of Bilibili Influencers

While Bilibili is primarily seen as a platform for Gen Z, about 80% of its 300 million active users are between the ages of 18 and 35. This makes it the perfect place for brands to try to reach the next up-and-coming generation of consumers.

Bilibili influencers operate similarly to influencers across other platforms. They're often given free products or services in exchange for reviews and promotions. But if you're looking to pay for influencer marketing, you can expect to pay between $100 to $2,000 for promotional videos. As Bilibili influencers often have much lower follower counts than their Western counterparts, you will find lower pricing here as well.

The most popular Bilibili influencers may charge significantly more for their services, sometimes reaching $20,000 a video. However, promotional videos costing between $500 to $1,000 are generally seen as the sweet spot in Bilibili influencer pricing. 

Influencer pricing can also vary depending on what services they offer, with live streams and product placements generally costing more than simply posting a video of them trying out your service or product.

## üõ≥Ô∏è Average Costs of Bilibili Influencer Promotion

 Bilibili influencer marketing pricing can vary. To give you a better idea of what to expect, here's a breakdown of average costs from a report on Bilibili influencer marketing in 2023, as well as insights into what factors may affect their overall pricing.
 
| **Average Cost** | **Description** |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
|   $500   | Average Bilibili influencer video |
|   $800-$?1,500 | Average cost of a Bilibili live stream |
|   $1,000-$20,000   | Average Bilibili influencer charges per video,  depending on audience size |
|  $1,000 to $2,000  | Average cost for Bilibili product placement |
|   $400 | Average Bilibili influencer charges for product review (non-video) |
|   $300 to $2,000 | Average Bilibili influencer charges for services |
|   20%|  Average commission offered to product reviewers |
|   6%  | Average commission offered to Bilibili influencers |

While the price range of Bilibili influencer promotion can vary, it does not vary as widely as you might think. Factors that can affect pricing are typically the same factors on any platform, including audience size, audience engagement, number of posts or videos provided, and commission offers.

### 1. Audience Size

As mentioned previously, Bilibili influencers tend to have lower follower counts than Western influencers. Most of the influencers on TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube have a follower count of 100,000 or more. Bilibili influencers, on the other hand, boast a much smaller following.

Here are a few stats on Bilibili influencers:

- 10% of Bilibili influencers have a follower count of over 1 million.
- 89% of Bilibili influencers have fewer than 50,000 followers, and only 2% have between 50,000 and 100,000 followers.
- The average follower count of Bilibili influencers is 39,000.

While a larger follower count can indicate higher prices, Bilibili influencers can also benefit from higher engagement rates. Bilibili influencers average an 8% engagement rate, which is 3% higher than the average engagement rate of influencers on other platforms.

### 2. Audience Engagement

On platforms like Instagram, audience engagement is often measured through likes and comments. But Bilibili takes engagement a step further by incorporating audience comments and bullet chat, which allows users to chat in real-time while watching a video. This helps create a more interactive experience for users while giving brands and Bilibili influencers a better idea of how engaged users really are.

### 3. Type of Promotion

While the majority of Bilibili influencer promotions center around short videos, you may also find influencers that perform longer-form content, such as live streams. Factors that may increase the price of Bilibili influencer marketing include:

- The length of a promotional video.
- Product placement within videos.
- Creation of multiple videos.
- A series of videos over several weeks.

### 4. Commission Offers

The majority of Bilibili influencer marketing relies heavily on commissions rather than flat rates. In fact, 80% of Bilibili influencers would prefer commission offers over flat fees for influencer marketing, while 60% of brands prefer the opposite. This can create difficulties for American brands trying to reach Chinese consumers, as the two sides would need to agree on a pricing structure that suits both parties.

The main benefits of commission offers are that they provide Bilibili influencers with more incentive to promote a product or service and that they help brands minimize risk. With commission offers, brands only pay for product sales, reducing the chance they waste marketing dollars on influencers that produce little to no returns.

## üìä Why Bilibili Influencers Have Lower Rates than Western Influencers

When comparing Bilibili influencer pricing to influencer pricing in the West, you may notice a significant difference. Influencers on platforms like Instagram and TikTok can charge anywhere from $1,000 to $20,000 per post, depending on follower count and engagement. Bilibili influencers charge significantly less than that. 

So why is this the case? Here are a few reasons Bilibili influencers charge lower rates than their Western counterparts.

### 1. Bilibili Influencer Prices Reflect a Different Market

Bilibili is primarily a Chinese platform, with very little recognition outside of China. TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube, on the other hand, are all globally recognized platforms. This means that Bilibili's target audience is much smaller than other platforms, creating a difference in pricing.

In addition, the average income of influencers in the West is higher than that of their Chinese counterparts. This is why Bilibili influencers can charge less and still make a decent living as an influencer.

### 2. Competition

Bilibili influencers face fierce competition from other Bilibili influencers. While American influencers may have to compete with a few thousand influencers, Bilibili influencers have to compete with millions of other users trying to rise to the top.

Because of the competition on Bilibili, influencers have to price their services lower to attract brands looking for promotional partnerships. 

### 3. Pricing Trends

Just like markets in the United States, influencer prices in China fluctuate as trends change. Between 2021 and 2023, the average promotional video price is estimated to have increased by 350%, while the average live stream price increased by an astounding 700% during the same time frame.

This suggests that Bilibili influencers still haven't reached their pricing ceiling. So while Bilibili influencer prices may be lower than those of other influencers at the moment, there's a good chance that they will rise in the coming years as influencer marketing continues to grow in popularity.
