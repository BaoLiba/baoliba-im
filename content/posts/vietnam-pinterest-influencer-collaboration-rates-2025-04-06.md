Pinterest is more than a visual discovery tool. It‚Äôs also a thriving place for brands to connect with influencer partners in Southeast Asia. Love it or hate it, it‚Äôs a necessary tool for digital marketers.

If your target audience includes Vietnam, you‚Äôll want to familiarize yourself with the local Pinterest influencer market and pricing standards.

## üí∞ The cost of working with Pinterest influencers in Vietnam

Pinterest doesn‚Äôt have the same predilection for influencer marketing that other platforms have. Influencers on Pinterest are not generally as transparent with their pricing.

As of 2023, the average cost of working with Pinterest influencers in Vietnam is between 100 and 500 USD per monthly subscription. Costs can vary significantly based on Pinterest influencers‚Äô audience size, engagement, and subscription length.

Subscription terms can average 1‚Äì3 months, but there are longer-term arrangements possible, depending on campaign goals.

Prices can go up to thousands of dollars per month depending on influencer metrics. No Pinterest influencer will disclose their exact pricing upfront. 

## üíµ Payment methods for Pinterest influencer collaborations in Vietnam

Most influencers in Vietnam will accept payment via PayPal, credit card, and direct bank transfer. 

PayPal is preferred by most influencers. They‚Äôll expect you to cover all transfer fees, which can become a costly affair depending on your subscription length and total agency fees.

Pinterest influencers may require a deposit before fulfilling their end of the deal, which can be 30% or more. They‚Äôll likely want the full payment upfront if they‚Äôre a top-tier influencer.

## üìä Average follower counts of Pinterest influencers in Vietnam

Pinterest influencers in Vietnam are not generally measured by follower count like other influencers on more traditional social sites. 

Engagement is key among Pinterest influencers. For example, a Pinterest influencer with over 10 million monthly views is considered top tier. In fact, this influencer average is equivalent to a YouTube influencer with at least 100,000 subscribers.

This makes Pinterest influencer marketing a more cost-effective option for brands.

### üí° Audience demographics compared to other platforms

Demographics for Pinterest users in Vietnam are also similar to other platforms. The average Pinterest audience in Vietnam skews female, like many other platforms. 

A majority of Pinterest users are in the 25-34 age range. This is a broader audience than what you‚Äôll find on most other social platforms.

- Age
    - 18-24: 24%
    - 25-34: 35%
    - 35-44: 15%
