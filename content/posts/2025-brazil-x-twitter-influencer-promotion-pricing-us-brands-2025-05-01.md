Brazil boasts one of the highest Twitter usage rates in the world, making the platform a natural, if underutilized, choice for social media influencer marketing.

While Brazilian influencers deploy a wide range of promotional tactics on the social media platform, US brands can expect to pay a premium for Twitter influencer marketing in Brazil versus other digital channels.

According to a 2025 pricing guide published by BaoLiba, a global influencer marketing platform, US brands should expect to pay a minimum of $1,170 per post for influencer marketing campaigns on Twitter in Brazil.

## üìä Twitter Influencer Marketing Pricing in Brazil

As the only social media platform where the ‚Äúinfluencer‚Äù label is a badge of honor, Twitter has long had a robust influencer marketing ecosystem in Brazil.

In fact, according to a 2023 report by Locowise, Brazilian influencers boast some of the highest engagement rates in the world among their social media counterparts.

In that same report, Locowise found that Twitter was the second most popular social media platform among Brazilian influencers after Instagram, with 62% of Brazilian influencers having Twitter accounts.

This popularity is reflected in the pricing for influencer marketing campaigns on Twitter in Brazil.

According to BaoLiba‚Äôs report, Brazilian influencers charge an average of $1,500 for a single tweet featuring a US brand, while the average price for a Twitter thread is $1,700.

The pricing for Brazilian Twitter influencers is considerably higher than that of their counterparts on social media platforms such as Instagram or TikTok.

### Summary of Pricing for Brazilian Twitter Influencers

| Content Type | Average Price |
|--------------|---------------|
| Single Tweet | $1,500        |
| Twitter Thread | $1,700      |
| Campaign Minimum | $1,170      |

## üí∞ How Payment Works for Brazilian Twitter Influencer Marketing

In addition to higher average prices, Brazilian Twitter influencers also typically prefer payment methods that differ from their counterparts in other countries.

According to BaoLiba‚Äôs pricing guide, while bank transfers are the most popular payment method among Brazilian Twitter influencers, they are closely followed by more modern payment methods such as PayPal and Wise.

### Payment Methods Most Popular Among Brazilian Twitter Influencers

| Payment Method | Percentage |
|----------------|------------|
| Bank Transfer  | 31%        |
| PayPal         | 30%        |
| Wise           | 25%        |
| Other          | 14%        |

The strong preference for PayPal among Brazilian Twitter influencers is particularly notable, with the platform enjoying a far higher use rate in Brazil than in the USA.

According to a 2021 report by Statista, only 10% of Americans used PayPal as their preferred payment method for online shopping. Conversely, Statista also reported that 49% of Brazilians named PayPal as their preferred payment method for online shopping.

This divergence reflects the fact that Brazilian consumers have generally adopted modern payment methods at a far higher rate than their counterparts in developed markets such as the USA.

## üßæ Legal Considerations for Influencer Marketing in Brazil

When it comes to influencer marketing in Brazil, US brands need to be aware that Brazil has relatively strict regulations governing the practice.

For example, Brazilian influencers are required to disclose their partnerships with brands in a clear and conspicuous manner. 

The Brazilian Advertising Self-Regulatory Council (CONAR) has even gone beyond simply requiring influencers to disclose their partnerships by issuing specific guidelines on how to do so.

For example, influencers may not simply say that a post is ‚Äúsponsored.‚Äù Instead, they must clearly state that they are being compensated for a specific promotion.

According to CONAR:

‚ÄúShorthand expressions that do not clarify the nature of the commercial relationship, such as ‚Äòsponsored‚Äô, ‚Äòad‚Äô, ‚Äòpartnership‚Äô, among others, do not meet this requirement.‚Äù

In addition to requiring clear and conspicuous disclosures of partnerships, CONAR also prohibits celebrity endorsements of any nature that may appear to endorse illegal behavior.

For example, according to CONAR, influencers may not promote gambling, drugs, tobacco, or even ‚Äúsubtle suggestions of sexual practices that imply or encourage the objectification of the human being.‚Äù

## üåé Popularity of Twitter in Brazil

Despite its dwindling popularity in the USA and elsewhere, Twitter remains one of the most popular social media platforms in Brazil, as evidenced by the high number of Brazilian influencers on the platform as well as their high engagement rates.

According to a 2023 report by Statista, Twitter ranks as the third most popular social media platform in Brazil, with 53% of Brazilians naming it as one of the leading platforms they use.

### Social Media Platforms Used by Brazilians

| Platform            | Percentage |
|---------------------|------------|
| WhatsApp            | 92%        |
| Instagram           | 85%        |
| Twitter             | 53%        |
| Facebook            | 50%        |
| TikTok              | 49%        |

The high rate of Twitter usage in Brazil compared to other countries is not a new phenomenon. In fact, according to a 2021 report by The Next Web, Brazil ranked as the third-largest market for Twitter worldwide, trailing only the USA and Japan.

## üéØ Popularity of Influencer Marketing in Brazil

Just as Twitter remains popular in Brazil compared to other countries, so too is influencer marketing within Brazil compared to other countries.

According to a 2023 report by Statista, Brazil ranks as the most lucrative influencer marketing market in the world, with the Brazilian influencer marketing industry generating an estimated $1.79 billion in 2023.

### Most Lucrative Influencer Markets Worldwide

| Country                   | Revenue in Millions USD |

| China                     | $1,600                   |
| Germany                   | $1,210                   |
| India                     | $1,150                   |

It should be noted that while the USA ranks second overall in terms of revenue from influencer marketing, it ranks first in average price per post across all influencer marketing platforms.

According to a 2024 pricing guide published by BaoLiba, the average price for influencer marketing campaigns in the USA is $1,090 per post.

### Average Pricing for Influencers Worldwide

| Country | Average Price |

| USA     | $1,090        |
| Brazil  | $1,050        |
| China   | $1,030        |
| India   | $970          |
| Germany | $950          |

The relatively high average prices for Brazilian influencers may reflect the fact that Brazil also ranks as one of the largest markets for influencer marketing in the world, with 303,000 influencers promoting products and services across social media platforms.

### Number of Influencers in Select Countries

| Country | Number of Influencers |
|---------|-----------------------|
