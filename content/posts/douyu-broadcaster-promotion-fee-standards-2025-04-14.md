Douyu is a famous Chinese live streaming platform similar to Twitch. It has a huge active user base and thrives on gaming content. Therefore, it is a great platform to work with Chinese influencers if you are an international gaming company or brand.

Moreover, Douyu influencers promote products beyond gaming. You can find influencers that cover various niches, even food. Besides, Douyu’s promotion pricing sounds very affordable to American brands. Reports say Douyu influencers can charge as little as 150 dollars per promotion post.

## 📊 Douyu Influencer Marketing Pricing Guide



Douyu influencer pricing is determined by several factors. Firstly, there are two types of Douyu influencers, the one with a blue badge and those without.

They are also more trustworthy to use for marketing. Therefore, Douyu influencers with a badge can charge a higher fee for promotions.

> **Tip:** Although working with badge influencers seems better, there are many incredibly talented Douyu influencers without a badge.

In dollars, that is roughly 150 to 1,500 dollars. However, some top Douyu influencers with millions of followers can charge as much as 100,000 yuan or 15,000 dollars per post.

### ❗ Douyu Influencer Marketing Potential Risks

When working with Douyu influencers, you may come across some scammers. Some Douyu influencers don’t really have any following but pretend to have.

To avoid falling victim to fraudsters, always verify that Douyu influencers have an active following. Inspect their follower’s growth to ensure they didn’t buy fake followers.
