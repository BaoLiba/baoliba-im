| 100,000+         | 10% - 15%               |


## üí∞ Why Are Dutch Snapchat Influencers More Expensive? 

Dutch Snapchat influencers are among the most expensive in the world, for several reasons. 

### ‚≠ê 1. Snapchat Is More Popular in the Netherlands than in the US

In Europe, Snapchat has a reputation as the cool social media app. It‚Äôs not just a platform for sharing videos and pictures, but for authentic, real-time interaction with friends.

It has become the go-to social media app for millions of young adults in the Netherlands. 

This is why Snapchat influencers are in such high demand to promote products and services. 

In fact, 60% of Dutch teens use Snapchat every day, compared to just 40% of teens in the USA.


### ‚≠ê 2. Dutch Snapchat Influencers Are Less Accessible

Many Snapchat influencers in the Netherlands are part of closed Snapchat accounts, which means they are less accessible than other influencers.

Users must apply to confirm their identity in order to join.

This exclusivity makes their content much more valuable, and businesses must pay a premium if they want to reach their audiences.


### ‚≠ê 3. Brand Safety

According to a 2022 report from the European Commission, only 39% of Dutch consumers trust online platforms to take action against illegal content or harmful practices.

This has prompted many brands in the Netherlands to switch to influencer marketing, as it is considered more trustworthy and reliable than traditional advertisements. 

Snapchat influencers are at the forefront of this trend, and many companies are willing to pay top dollar to work with them.


### ‚≠ê 4. The Netherlands Has a Higher Cost of Living

The Netherlands has one of the highest costs of living in the world, and this higher cost is passed on to consumers. 

For example, a Big Mac costs an average of ‚Ç¨5.75 in the Netherlands, while it costs ‚Ç¨4.50 in the USA.

Dutch Snapchat influencers expect to be compensated fairly according to the cost of living in their country, and brands must be prepared to pay more if they want to work with them.

## üéØ What Is the Most Common Type of Snapchat Sponsored Post in the Netherlands? 

In the Netherlands, Snapchat stories are the most common type of sponsored post. 

These stories consist of 5-10 individual slides of images or video, and they can be combined with polls, quizzes, or other types of interactive content. 

The average cost of a Snapchat story is around ‚Ç¨5,000.

### üìπ What Is a Sponsored Snap?

A sponsored snap is a single image or video that is sent directly to an influencer‚Äôs followers. 

These paid snaps cost an average of ‚Ç¨1,500.


### ü§ù What Other Types of Sponsored Content Are There?

There are many types of sponsored content that can be used in Snapchat marketing campaigns. 

In addition to stories and snaps, influencers can promote products by simply wearing them or by mentioning brands in their content. 

These types of sponsored posts are less effective, but they are also less expensive, so they can help you save money when you are working with a budget.

| Sponsored Content   | Average Cost  |
|---------------------|---------------|
| Stories             | ‚Ç¨5,000        |
| Snaps               | ‚Ç¨1,500        |
| Wearing the Brand   | ‚Ç¨2,500        |
| Brand Mentions      | ‚Ç¨1,000        |

- **Content Approvals** - Ask if you can approve content before it is published.
- **Deadlines** - Discuss when the content will be published so you can plan around it.
- **Payment Terms** - Discuss payment terms to make sure both parties are satisfied.

- **Content Requirements** - Outline what kind of content they will create, including format and length.
- **Content Approvals** - Specify if you will have the right to approve content before it is published.

There are several ways you can make international payments, including:

1. **Bank Wire Transfer** ‚Äì A direct transfer of funds from one bank account to another. 
2. **PayPal** ‚Äì A widely used online payment system. 
3. **Wise** ‚Äì A money transfer service that offers cheaper and faster international payments. 
4. **Cryptocurrency** ‚Äì Some influencers may accept Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.

### üìä 6. Measure Results

After the campaign is completed, be sure to evaluate the results. 

If you achieved your campaign goals, consider working with the influencer again in the future. 

If not, you may want to change influencers or try a different marketing strategy altogether.

However, be prepared to pay a premium for Dutch Snapchat influencers in 2025. 

Prices will range from ‚Ç¨1,500 to ‚Ç¨10,000 for a single sponsored post, depending on the influencer‚Äôs reach.
