Influencer marketing is flourishing in Vietnam. In recent years, Vietnamese influencers and bloggers have been creating successful campaigns for international brands. If you‚Äôre looking to tap into that market, Blogspot is one of the most widely used platforms in Vietnam.

In fact, Blogspot is the most popular platform for bloggers across Southeast Asia. If you want to reach Vietnamese audiences, Blogspot will give you the biggest bang for your buck.


## üìö Why Blogspot?

First of all, Blogspot is extremely popular in Vietnam. According to a statistic from Statista, Blogspot ranks as the third most-used social media platform in Vietnam below Youtube and Facebook.

Moreover, Blogspot provides Vietnamese bloggers with a simple yet effective platform. It is easy to navigate and requires little coding knowledge. Once you get that basic set up, it allows for a great degree of customization.

They can always customize their Blogspot accounts to suit their aesthetic. That‚Äôs part of the reason it‚Äôs so popular with influencers. Influencers in Southeast Asia love to showcase their personality, style, and interests with their followers.


## üì∏ Pricing for Blogspot Collaborations

In 2023, the price for advertising on Blogspot blogs can vary greatly depending on different factors. Below is a list of possible fees associated with advertising on Blogspot blogs.

Marketing with Bloggers in Vietnam will not break the bank. For the price of coffee at Starbucks, you can have a Blogspot influencer post about your product.


## üõ°Ô∏è Payment Methods

Vietnamese people are not keen on credit cards. In fact, it is reported that only 29% of Vietnamese adults have a credit card. 

Consequently, when collaborating with Blogspot influencers, it‚Äôs best to stick with cash. The most commonly accepted payment methods in Vietnam are Bank Transfer, Paypal, and cash. 

However, only a handful of popular Blogspot bloggers will accept Paypal. The time it takes to transfer money with Paypal is not in line with the fast-paced environment of Vietnam. 


## üí≤ Currency

Vietnam uses the Vietnamese Dong (VND) as its currency. 


## üìë Legal Issues

When working with Vietnamese Blogspot influencers, be aware that they may have their own legal requirements. Nevertheless, the contracts they provide will likely be informal.

If you need a legally binding contract, it's best to have your lawyer draft one.


## üìÜ Timeline

As mentioned previously, a sponsored Blogspot post will only take a few days to complete. If you are working with a popular influencer it may take longer since they are likely to be busy.

However, once you agree to terms and payment, you can expect a Blogspot influencer to stick to their word. Vietnamese people are known for valuing timeliness. 


## üî• Conclusion

There‚Äôs no denying that Vietnam is a hotbed for influencer marketing. In fact, according to The Influencer Marketing Factory, the Vietnamese influencer marketing industry is expected to grow from 117 million US dollars in 2022 to 408 million US dollars by 2025.

If you are considering using influencer marketing to promote your brand in Vietnam, Blogspot influencers are a great way to start. It is fast, easy, and will not put a dent in your budget.
