## üìà How Influencers on WeTV in Thailand Are Paid

Similar to other influencer platforms, Thai influencers on WeTV can be paid through a variety of methods, including cash, gift cards, free products, and services. 

However, cash remains the most popular and widely accepted method for payment. 

### üí≥ Cash Payments 

WeTV influencers in Thailand can expect to receive their payment for promotional campaigns in cash or through bank transfers after they complete a campaign and send proof to the advertiser that they completed the task.

The more followers and likes you have, the more you can charge for a marketing campaign. 

### üéÅ Gifts, Products, and Services

While cash payments are the most popular method, many Thai influencers on WeTV also accept vouchers, products, and services as payment for their marketing campaigns.

Many influencers prefer to receive something they can use or have a need for, which often results in them charging less for their marketing services. 

### ‚ùó The Pitfalls of WeTV Influencer Exchanges

Although it is possible for some influencers on WeTV in Thailand to receive their payment in gift cards, products, or services, doing so can often become a headache for many influencers.

Some advertisers may send gift cards with no balance or with only a limited amount of funds that cannot be used for what the influencer needs.

## ü•á How to Get Started as a WeTV Influencer in Thailand

With the right combination of quality content production and marketing skills, you can become a successful influencer on WeTV. 

For starters, you need to sign up as a creator on WeTV. Once your application is accepted, you can begin uploading videos and building your following.

### üì∏ Keep Content Fresh 

The easiest way to become a successful influencer on WeTV is to continually produce and upload fresh content. 

The more videos you can produce and upload to WeTV, the more views and followers you can gain. 

### ‚è∞ Use a Consistent Posting Schedule 

Try to upload new videos to your WeTV channel according to a consistent posting schedule. Your followers will come to expect new content on specific days, and this will encourage them to keep coming back for more. 

### üîç Use Keywords 

WeTV works just like YouTube when it comes to delivering content to users. The more people search for content that matches the keywords you use in your content, the more WeTV will recommend your videos to new viewers. 

### üì± Promote on Other Channels  

In addition to producing and uploading high-quality videos to your WeTV channel, you should also promote your WeTV channel on other social media platforms. 

Let your followers on Instagram, TikTok, or Facebook know that they can also find your videos on WeTV. Encourage them to follow you there, and increase your viewer count even more. 

### üéâ Participate in WeTV Activities 

WeTV sometimes organizes online activities such as contests where you can win prizes and gain more views for your videos. Participating in these activities can help you build your following. 

## ‚ùó Risks of Working with Influencers on WeTV in Thailand

While working with influencers on WeTV in Thailand can be a powerful way to promote your brand, there are also some risks involved that you should be aware of.

### üî¥ Poor Quality Work 

Although many influencers on WeTV are professionals, some are not. This means that they may not produce high-quality videos that get your brand the attention you want. 

You should thoroughly vet any influencer before hiring them to represent your brand. 

### üî¥ Fake Followers 

Another risk of hiring influencers on WeTV in Thailand is that some may have purchased fake followers.

Just because an influencer has a lot of followers does not mean that they are all real people.

Hiring influencers with fake followers won‚Äôt guarantee you the exposure that you want, and they may not have the power to raise your brand‚Äôs profile.

### üî¥ Failing to Follow Rules

Many advertisers fail to follow the rules when it comes to working with influencers on WeTV in Thailand.  

For instance, some brands may hire an influencer to promote their product in just one video, only to find that the influencer does the same promotion for the next ten videos.

This will not only look unprofessional, but it can also get your brand banned from working with other influencers on WeTV in Thailand.

## üì¢ Conclusion

While there can be several pitfalls that come with working with influencers on WeTV in Thailand, properly vetting and evaluating potential influencers can help you avoid those pitfalls.

Make sure to establish clear guidelines for your campaign from the beginning, and this can help prevent any confusion or issues later on.
