Understanding the pricing of influencer promotions on Facebook in Greece is crucial for discerning USA brands looking to tap into the Greek market. 

With an adult population of over 10.5 million, Greece has a robust Facebook presence, boasting 7.2 million active users with 5 million logging on daily. 

Never fear; this article breaks down the average fees for both micro and mega influencers in Greece, how to hire Greek influencers, and the scams to avoid. 

## üè∑Ô∏è Greek influencer marketing rates 
Influencer marketing is on the rise in Greece, particularly on social media platforms like Facebook. 

The pricing for influencer promotions in Greece varies according to follower counts:

 - Micro (1,000 - 10,000 followers): 100 - 200 euros
 - Mid-tier (10,000 - 100,000): 200 - 1,000 euros 
 - Macro (100,000 - 1 million): 1,000 - 3,000 euros 
 - Mega (1 million+): 3,000 - 25,000 euros 

It‚Äôs important to note that these are the average fees. They may fluctuate due to niche, audience engagement, and content originality. 

The pricing can also change if paid promotions are added, content format varies (e.g., video ads are pricier), or if a sponsorship seal is included. 

## üìà Influencer fee breakdown by size 

### 1. Micro influencers
Micro influencers are those with 1,000 to 10,000 followers. They have an average promotional pricing range of 100 to 200 euros. 

Micro influencers are all about building personal relationships with their followers, making them more relatable than other influencer types. 

A typical micro influencer Facebook promotion includes a dedicated photo post and caption, perhaps with the product shown. 

Their follower count may be small, but their engagement rates can be incredibly high. Stats show that micro influencers increase conversions by 6.9 times than non-influencers. 

As such, micro influencers are often the go-to choice for brands looking for cost-effective marketing solutions. 

### 2. Mid-tier influencers

Mid-tier influencers command higher-than-average fees than micro influencers, but they still represent a good value. 

Those with 10,000 to 100,000 followers charge between 200 and 1,000 euros for influencer promotions on Facebook. 

Unlike micro influencers, mid-tier influencers tend to focus more on niche topics. For instance, they might specialize in home d√©cor, travel, or food. 

While this might limit their reach, it also increases their relevance to their audience. This results in more effective promotions and higher conversions. 

### 3. Macro influencers

Macro influencers boast between 100,000 to 1 million followers, commanding fees ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 euros. 

While they typically only have a 1% engagement rate, macro influencers deliver great value for brands looking to quickly build awareness. 

Additionally, macro influencers often produce more engaging content than micro and mid-tier influencers, boosting conversions further. 

Due to their larger audience size, macro influencers often partner with brands on long-term sponsorship deals. 

For instance, Greek YouTuber and mega influencer Christos Kallivretakis, who boasts a high-engagement 1.68 million followers, shares sponsored links, branded merchandise, and promotional videos on all his platforms. 

### 4. Mega influencers

Mega influencers are those with over 1 million followers. They are the celebrity tier of influencers, commanding anywhere between 3,000 to 25,000 euros for Facebook promotions. 

While they are the least relatable influencer type, mega influencers can deliver brands quick exposure and immense reach. 

As a result, mega influencers are often more flexible than their counterparts, often developing tailored, unique content to suit brand requests. 

For instance, Greek-American singer and actress Jennifer Lopez, who has an impressive 451 million followers on Facebook, often collaborates with high-profile brands like Dior and Gucci. 

## üí± How to pay influencers in Greece?

Now that you understand the basic costs, how does one go about hiring a Greek influencer? 

Below are some recommendations for the best practices to adopt when hiring Greek influencers and making payments. 

### 1. Find and hire an influencer

You can either reach out to Greek influencers directly or work with influencer marketing agencies that specialize in the Greek market. 

Some popular influencer agencies in Greece include:

- **Socialista** 

This influencer marketing agency is based in Greece, specializing in connecting brands with popular influencers.

- **GMMB**

When it comes to payments, these are the most common options for influencer promotions in Greece:

- PayPal
- Bank transfer
- Wire 
- Cryptocurrency 


## ‚ö†Ô∏è What are the common influencer scams in Greece?

While influencer marketing offers numerous advantages for brands, it‚Äôs crucial to stay vigilant against scams that can prey on unsuspecting companies. 

Here are some red flags to watch for when working with influencers in Greece: 

### 1. Fake followers

One of the most common scams involves influencers inflating their follower counts with fake accounts. 

While it might be tempting to sign on influencers boasting large follower counts, it‚Äôs important to do due diligence to verify their authenticity. 

Some telltale signs of fake accounts include:

- Profiles with no photos or posts 
- Account names with numbers or random letters 
- Private accounts 
- Profiles with only a few followers 

Additionally, you can use online tools like HypeAuditor, SocialBlade, and FollowerCheck to gauge an influencer‚Äôs reach, engagement rates, and real follower counts. 

### 2. Fake engagement

An influencer can appear legitimate by having tons of followers, but that doesn‚Äôt guarantee they have a high engagement rate. 

Fake influencers often engage in exchange-for-engagement schemes, where they agree to like and comment on each other‚Äôs posts. 

As a result, they can appear popular and have great cover, but have little to no organic engagement from their followers. 

Brands can fall prey to fake engagement because metrics don‚Äôt tell the whole story. 

Some signs that the engagement might be fake include:

- Overly generic comments 
- Irrelevant comments 
- Little to no followers on commenters‚Äô profiles 


### 3. Payment scams
While PayPal, bank transfers, and other payment methods are common when paying influencers, there are scams to watch for. 

For instance, you might come across influencers that request payment upfront before delivering content. 

While this might seem reasonable, some influencers may accept payment and then ghost brands. 

To avoid getting scammed, always pay influencers after they deliver agreed-upon deliverables. 

### 4. Ghosting after payment
Some influencers may appear legitimate and promise to deliver high-quality content, but fail to follow through. 

These influencers may ghost brands after receiving payment or provide low-quality content that doesn‚Äôt meet expectations. 

To avoid this scam, ensure that you create an agreement that outlines the deliverables, timeline, posting dates, and payment methods.
