According to a study done by statista, around 76% of marketers stated that they plan on increasing their influencer marketing budgets in the future. Influencer marketing has been a great way of reaching more audiences and targeting specific demographics that are hard to find.


Although Sweden doesn‚Äôt currently rank among the top countries in Europe for influencer marketing, it is steadily becoming a hotspot for brands looking to promote themselves internationally.


After the recent merger of Twitter with American entrepreneur Elon Musk‚Äôs companies, Twitter has changed its name to X. It is reported that about 90% of the social media service‚Äôs revenue comes from paid advertising, and most of it comes from influencer marketing.


The account of a single influencer on the X platform is confirmed to be worth more than a dozen offers and promotions on other social media platforms.


For Swedish influencers, it is reported that X accounts are even more valuable than Instagram and YouTube accounts. This means that for Swedish influencers that have established themselves on X, the cost of hiring them for promotion will be higher.


In this article, we will discuss the pricing and engagement rates for Swedish influencers on X in 2025 and how US brands can get the best deals from these influencers.


## üìä Why is influencer marketing necessary for Swedish audiences?
According to a survey conducted among Swedish users of social media, about 78% of respondents stated that they trust influencer opinions when making purchasing decisions.


Most of them stated that they are likely to follow a recommendation made by a popular influencer. 


With 63% saying they would even switch to another brand if their favorite influencer told them to. This suggests that influencer marketing can be a strong promotional tool for companies.


In Sweden, influencer marketing develops through publicly funded initiatives and is increasing in popularity. 


A recent report by Influencer Marketing Hub found that 58% of marketers believe influencer marketing is the future of marketing.


Due to the high level of trust that Swedish audiences have in influencer promotions, US brands can introduce their products and services to numerous Swedish audiences through influencer marketing.


## üí° A look at the engagement rates of Swedish influencers on social media
Influencer marketing requires brands to partner with users of social media who have a high number of followers and engagement rates. 


Engagement rates refer to how many of an influencer's total followers actually react to their posts or interact with their content.


The average engagement rate is the number of post engagements divided by the total number of followers.


## Average engagement rates by Swedish influencers on social media platforms


| **Social media platform** | **Average engagement rate** |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| YouTube                   | 0.29%                       |
| Instagram                 | 0.93%                       |
| TikTok                    | 4.20%                       |
| X                         | 1.42%                       |


The average engagement rate in Sweden for influencers on X is 1.42%. This is higher than the average engagement rates of influencers in Sweden on YouTube and Instagram.


X platforms also have a higher engagement rate than the social media app TikTok. These social media stats suggest that brands can get good returns from promotions on X.


However, Swedish influencers that promote brands on X do charge higher prices than influencers on other social media platforms.

## üìà How much will it cost to hire a Swedish influencer on X in 2025?
On average, Swedish influencers charge between $150 and $2000 for brand promotions on X in 2025.


This price is lower than the average price of hiring influencers in other countries to promote brands on X.

## 2025 Average cost to hire influencers on X around the world
| **Country** | **Cost ($)** |
| ------------| -------------|
| USA          | 3,500       |
| Canada       | 2,800       |
| Australia    | 2,200       |
| Germany      | 1,500       |
| Sweden       | 1,000       |
| UK           | 900         |

In the table above, it can be seen that the average cost of hiring Swedish influencers on the X platform is lower than that of influencers from Canada and the USA.


This means that US brands can save a considerable amount of money for promotions by hiring Swedish influencer on X rather than influencers from their home country.


## ‚≠ê What to consider when hiring Swedish influencers for promotions?
When looking for Swedish influencers to promote your brand on X, it is important to check the following before making a hiring decision:


1. **Niche**: You can find influencers in virtually every niche imaginable, so it is important to hire influencers that are relevant to your specific niche.  


2. **Fit**: Try to determine whether the influencers' audience is the right fit for your brand and whether their values align with yours. 


3. **Authenticity**: Check if the influencer has fake followers or engagement, as this can affect the quality of promotion.


4. **Deliverables**: Brands should ask influencers for a clear list of what they will deliver, including the type of post, any hashtags or links, the timing of the post, and any specific messaging to include.


5. **Rate**: Brands should inquire about the influencer‚Äôs rate and what it includes. Some influencers may offer discounts for longer campaigns or bundles of content.


6. **Terms**: Brands should establish clear terms regarding payment, content ownership, usage rights, and any other relevant details.


7. **Contract**: It is often a good idea to formalize the arrangement with a contract that outlines the terms of the collaboration, including payment, timelines, and deliverables.


8. **Contact details**: Be sure to gather the influencer‚Äôs contact details, such as email and phone number, for communication.


## ‚ùó Payment for promotions on X by Swedish influencers
When hiring Swedish influencers on X for promotions, US brands can pay them using several different methods. 


These include wire transfers, PayPal, Venmo, and credit cards. 


Due to the high number of tourists that countries like Sweden receive every year, most Swedish influencers would not find it a problem if brands paid them directly using their local currency.


Swedish currency is called the krona. One US dollar is equivalent to about 11 Swedish krona. 


This means that if a Swedish influencer charges 1,000 krona to promote a brand on X, US brands will only be required to pay around $90 to hire them for a promotion.


### How to pay Swedish influencers from the USA
If you are based in the US, one of the easiest ways to pay a Swedish influencer for a promotion on X is by using PayPal. 


You will first need to create a PayPal account if you don‚Äôt already have one.


Then, you will need to link your US bank account or credit card to your PayPal account. 


Once your account is set up and funded, you can send money to the Swedish influencer‚Äôs PayPal account by entering their PayPal payment details and the amount you wish to send. 


PayPal will convert the USD amount to SEK and send the payment on your behalf.


Another option is to use international wire transfers. However, this method can be more complicated and may incur higher fees than using PayPal.


Depending on their preference, you can ask the influencer for details about the payment method they would like.


Once you have made the payment, be sure to keep a record of the transaction for your records.
