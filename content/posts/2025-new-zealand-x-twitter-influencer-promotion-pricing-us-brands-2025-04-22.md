Given their long-standing, strong sense of individuality, Kiwis will remain largely unconvinced that US brands have more insight on how to effectively market products and services in their streets and homes than they do.

High demands, however, for the latest items from US brands will continue to draw them in, and Kiwi influencers on popular social media site X (known formerly as Twitter) are answering the call. 

The impact of Kiwi influencers who are fluent in the regional dialect of US brands is making them valuable allies to the success of those brands.

But how much do New Zealand influencers charge to promote US brands over X in 2025? 

## üè• Why are New Zealand influencers costly?

Kiwi influencers on X charge hefty fees for their promotional services. Would-be partners should expect to pay anywhere from $75 to $2,500NZD per post promoting a US brand on X.

Depending on audience reach, video promotion on X can cost between $2,500 to $47,500NZD. The higher the follower count and engagement rate, the more significant the price tag.

### üìä New Zealand influencer rates for promoting US brands on X

Below is the December 2025 cost breakdown for promotional posts on New Zealand influencer accounts across X set in New Zealand dollar amounts.  

- **Standard Text Post (No Image/Video)**: $75 - 300NZD
- **Text & Image Post**: $150 - 900NZD
- **Text, Image & Video Post**: $200 - 2,500NZD
- **Video Post**: $2,500 - 47,500NZD
- **Influencer Account Verified**: $1,000NZD per month

While these prices appear relatively high for a country with a population of just five million, they are on par with influencer promotional rates across social media platforms globally. 

In addition, they reflect the high demand for quality promotions and the greater return on investments they enable for US brands.

In a July 2025 press release, New Zealand advertising agency The Workshop stated that the country‚Äôs influencer marketing sector is on the verge of a massive boom due to the explosion of promotional content across social platforms.

‚ÄúInfluencer marketing is no longer on the fringe of media but is now a legitimate and powerful force multiplier in the mix,‚Äù said David Spence, The Workshop's content director.

## ü§î Why are New Zealand influencers so effective?

Kiwi influencers are adept at connecting within their communities as they speak the local dialect. 

This makes their endorsements resonate with their followers, persuading them to earnestly consider the promoted offers.  

It is this sense of authenticity that ranks Kiwi influencers among the most sought after for effective promotions on X by brands across the world. 

In a 2025 guest article for the New Zealand Marketing Association, Katherine Wills, a professional influencer who runs her own agency, said that Kiwi influencers are the bounciest people you can find to promote products and services.

‚ÄúThey give you the hard facts, the experience, the sizzle ‚Äî and then they deliver a blow to the gut when they tell you their rates,‚Äù she said.

According to Wills, New Zealand influencers aren't just a bunch of happy-go-lucky wannabes who troll the net for requests to empty their pockets for a chance to be promoted on New Zealand's most renowned influencer platforms.

To the contrary, she stated, they are all business, and products and services that cannot stand up to scrutiny are often left unheard of.

### üìà How valuable is influencer marketing in New Zealand?

Despite their high rates, Kiwi influencers are projected to bring in an estimated $300 million dollars into the country‚Äôs economy by 2026.

A report by New Zealand‚Äôs Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment in 2025 revealed the country‚Äôs influencer marketing sector is on pace to be valued at $1 billion by 2028. 

The report stated that influencers in New Zealand currently have an influence on the decisions of 50% of consumers across the country ‚Äî and that rate is expected to increase to 90% within the next 10 years.

A separate report by Aotearoa New Zealand‚Äôs largest media company, Discovery, confirmed that 44% of Kiwis are on social media every day. 

This same report stated that 67% of Kiwis follow at least one influencer account on social media. Of these, half report feeling positively influenced by their content and spend an average of $77NZD extra a week on products and services they promoted.

In light of these trends, it is no surprise that US brands are flocking to establish promotional partnerships with Kiwi influencers on X.

## üí° What is New Zealand ‚Äòinfluencer speak‚Äô?

Although New Zealanders speak English, they occasionally punctuate their speech with local colloquialisms that can be hard for non-Kiwis to follow.

However, while Kiwi influencers will adapt their promotional content to cater to international audiences, they may not be aware of their audience‚Äôs cultural context. 

This is why engaging a Kiwi influencer who is fluent in US dialect is critical for the success of promoting US brands on X.

## üö® What to avoid when engaging Kiwi influencers on X

When engaging a Kiwi influencer on X to promote your US brand, it is best to avoid making demands that may offend them. 

In a May 2025 article posted on the influencer platform The Social Club, local influencer Grace Palmer cautioned that some US brands tend to make assumptions that can lead to misunderstandings at best and upset influencer partners at worst. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs best to come to the table with an open mind, and don‚Äôt assume we do things the same way as you,‚Äù she wrote. 

## üìù Cost-effective ways to engage Kiwi influencers on X

Kiwi influencers are costly, but they don't always have to be. If your budget is tight, you may engage their services without making any monetary payments.

Many Kiwi influencers are open to receiving free products and services in exchange for their promotional posts. 

This is why it is beneficial to approach them with offers that they will find valuable ‚Äî if not irresistible.

A 2025 report by 2020 Marketing revealed that many Kiwis are still not comfortable with influencer marketing even as its popularity rises. 

The report stated that a sizable portion of consumers believe many influencers promote products and services that they have no affinity for or have never even used.

This perception could be a boon for US brands that offer promotional products and services that resonate with Kiwi influencers. 

If an influencer is already a fan of your brand, chances are they will gladly promote it on X in exchange for more of your stuff.

They may even throw in some freebies for their followers to win.
