When it comes to influencer marketing, Twitter is probably the last platform that comes to mind. 

So, when you decide to leverage Twitter influencers for your marketing campaigns in 2025, you might be surprised by their rates, especially if your chosen influencers are from Korea.

Unlike their counterparts on TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube, who consistently overcharge brands for even the slightest promotion, Korean Twitter influencers are generally more modest in their pricing.

## üíµ Korean Twitter Influencer Pricing

As a brand, you should expect Korean Twitter influencers to charge between $50 and $200 per promotional tweet. 

The final cost depends on several factors, including the influencer's follower count, engagement rate, and the duration of the promotion. 

For example, an influencer with 10,000 followers and 1,000 impressions on their tweets will charge a brand around $50 for a promotional tweet. 

Conversely, an influencer with over 1 million followers and over 100,000 impressions on their tweets will charge an average of $200 for a promotional tweet.

If you want to promote your brand on Twitter multiple times, some influencers will offer packages that will significantly lower the cost per tweet.

## üßÆ Price Determinants for Korean Twitter Influencers

Several factors determine how much you can expect to pay a Korean Twitter influencer for promotional services, including:

### üî¢ Follower Count

Although follower count is often seen as a vanity metric in influencer marketing, it is still considered one of the main factors used to determine pricing. 

Korean Twitter influencers with more followers almost always charge higher fees than their peers with fewer followers.

### üìä Engagement Rate

Korean Twitter influencers with higher engagement rates tend to charge higher fees than those with lower engagement rates. 

Therefore, make sure to choose an influencer with solid engagement to avoid wasting money on a promotional tweet that yields few results.

### üìù Promotional Duration

Many Korean Twitter influencers offer package deals to brands looking for multiple promotional tweets. 

However, the more prolonged the promotion, the higher the overall promotional cost. 

For example, an influencer may charge $50 for a single promotional tweet but offer five tweets for $200. 

### üìπ Media Type

Korean Twitter influencers can incorporate various media into their promotional tweets, including images, GIFs, and videos. 

Influencers who use media that requires more effort to produce, such as videos and GIFs, tend to charge higher fees for their promotional tweets than those who only use images.

### üë©‚Äçüíª Quality of Content

Brands looking for high-quality promotional content must be willing to pay higher rates for Korean Twitter influencers' promotional tweets. 

Conversely, influencers who produce lower-quality content tend to charge lower rates for promotional tweets.
