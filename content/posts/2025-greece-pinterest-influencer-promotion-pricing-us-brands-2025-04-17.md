As the digital landscape continues to evolve, brands worldwide are exploring new avenues for reaching their consumers. While influencers in Greece have long been engaging users on Instagram and TikTok, Pinterest is emerging as a new frontier for influencer promotion.

Although the use of Pinterest for business marketing is less common in Europe than the U.S., influencers from the country are making their presence felt on the platform. Their style and flair are helping brands reach a desirable audience.

American brands are wise to take note of Greece influencers on Pinterest, especially in 2025, when influencer pricing will be competitive compared to the U.S. prices, yet will offer a unique approach to promoting across the social media channel.

## üí∞ Pinterest influencer promotion pricing in Greece for U.S. brands

Research from the site Statista indicated that Pinterest was used by 37% of the 1,000 participants in a survey of company representatives across Western Europe. The same research found that the platform was used by 50% of the 1,500 respondents in North America thus confirming that Pinterest is not leveraged to the same extent by European marketers as their American counterparts.

This gap in usage presents an opportunity for American brands to enter the Greece influencer market on Pinterest.

So what can American brands expect to spend on influencer promotions from Greece?  

- **Pinterest post: ‚Ç¨200 - ‚Ç¨400**   
- **Pinterest board creation and management: ‚Ç¨600 - ‚Ç¨1,200**  
- **Pinterest video: ‚Ç¨250 - ‚Ç¨500**  
- **Pinterest ads management: ‚Ç¨500 - ‚Ç¨1,500**   
- **Promoted Pinterest pins & video ads: ‚Ç¨300 - ‚Ç¨600**  
- **Pinterest SEO: ‚Ç¨250 - ‚Ç¨750**  

Prices are based on quotes from Greek influencers and agency representatives. It‚Äôs important to keep in mind that prices are often negotiable, so brands should feel free to haggle.

Greece prices may appear pricey compared to what American brands are currently paying in 2023 but these costs are relatively lower than U.S. influencer costs. 

The price for a Pinterest post from a U.S. influencer with about 100,000 followers averages around $1,600, according to influencer marketing platform, Izea.  

Pinterest board creation and management pricing for American influencers is about $1,500, while Pinterest ads management is $2,000.

This means American brands can expect to save around 40% through influencer promotions from Greece on Pinterest.

Greeks are known for their dramatic flair and those working as influencers leverage that to present ideas in a unique eye-catching manner.  

When it comes to Pinterest, a platform that is visual-centric, that content differentiation makes all the difference.

### üåç How American brands can pay Greek influencers

American brands planning to engage Greece influencers on Pinterest will need to secure a method to pay the influencers.

Many influencers will work through a management agency which will help facilitate payment. However, for those working independently, American brands will likely be required to pay through one of the following:

- **PayPal**  
- **Wise**  
- **Western Union**  


One of the most efficient ways to pay for services across borders is to use Wise, an online banking alternative that allows users to send money at mid-market exchange rates with low fees.  

A standard bank transfer may cost around $50.00, while the same transaction on Wise will cost around $2.00 or less.  

The average transaction time on Wise is around 1 hour, compared to the average of 3 days with a standard bank transfer.  

PayPal charges 5% of the transaction amount to receive money.  

Amateur influencers will likely work for free in exchange for commission fees, which can be paid via a link to a brand‚Äôs shopping cart or other e-commerce methods.  

Western Union has been a trusted name in money transfers for decades, making it a good option for brands that want the security and reputation of a legacy firm.

American brands can take measures to mitigate any risks associated with Greece Pinterest influencers by conducting thorough background checks before moving forward.

Here are several strategies brands can use to vet Greece Pinterest influencers.  

### ‚úîÔ∏è Check social media presence

Brands should check the influencer's other social media accounts to see if they are active and engaged on those platforms as well.  

If they only have a presence on Pinterest, it could be an indicator they have a low engagement rate or other issues.  

### ‚úîÔ∏è Look at comments

Brands should pay attention to comments made by others on the influencer's posts.  

Positive comments indicate that followers appreciate what the influencer is doing, while negative feedback could indicate a problem.

### ‚úîÔ∏è Ask for a media kit

Brands should require influencers to provide a media kit that outlines their audience demographics, engagement statistics and previous collaborations.  

This allows brands to assess if the influencer aligns with their target market and can deliver the desired results.  

### ‚úîÔ∏è Start with a small campaign  

Brands can initiate a trial run with a limited budget or a specific campaign to gauge the influencer's effectiveness without committing to a larger investment upfront.  

This will give brands insight into the influencer's ability to deliver results, style and quality of content.  

## üì¢ Conclusion
