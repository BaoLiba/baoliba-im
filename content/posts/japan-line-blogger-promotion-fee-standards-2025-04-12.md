## 🤳 Pricing Factors for LINE Influencer Marketing in Japan

While the follower count is a key pricing factor, brands should consider other qualities before booking an influencer. Here are some of the most prominent pricing factors. 

### 🤝 Engagement Rate  

The influencer's engagement rate is a significant indicator of how close they are to their followers. Influencers with a higher engagement rate can expect to charge more for their services as they have more power and influence with their audience. Here are the average percentage ranges of engagement rates by influencer tiers: 

- Mega: < 1%
- Macro: 2% to 5%
- Micro: 5% to 15%
- Nano: 15% to 30% 


### 🎯 Niche or Industry 

Some niches can charge a premium because they cater to audiences that are willing to spend more. For instance, an influencer in the luxury niche may charge more than a beauty influencer. Other niches that can expect to yield a higher fee than average are: 

- Fashion
- Finance
- Technology
- Health & Fitness 


### 📅 Campaign specifics 

More elaborate campaigns will typically cost more than simple product placements. The specifics of the campaign can include: 

- Length of campaign
- Number of posts or promotional materials
- Creation of promotional materials
- Exclusivity 


## 🧮 Video vs Static Post Pricing 

Video promotions tend to be more expensive than static posts. According to a survey by HypeAuditor, an influencer can charge upwards of 5x more for a video post than a static post. 

### 📽️ Promotional video on LINE

Promotional videos on LINE can range from $500 to $7,500, depending on the influencer tier. 

### 📸 Static posts on LINE

Static posts on LINE will typically range from $20 to $1,500, depending on the influencer tier.

## 🚫 Common Influencer Pricing Pitfalls to Avoid

As tempting as it may be to go for the influencer charging the lowest price, this isn’t always the best option. Low prices can often indicate poor performance and even fake followers. 

### 📈 The Cost of Cheap Influencers 

Cheap influencers can result in wasted marketing budgets and a failed campaign that doesn't yield any results. Working with an influencer that has a pricing tier below where they should be can also indicate that they’re looking to grow their following, and this may result in them working with multiple brands in your same niche, which can damage their authenticity and authority. 

### 🧐 How to Spot Fake Influencers 

Here are some signs to look out for when hunting for a dependable influencer: 

- Low engagement rate
- Average comments are random emojis
- Huge spikes in their follower count 
- Lack of 3rd party verification 
- Large portion of followers from other countries
