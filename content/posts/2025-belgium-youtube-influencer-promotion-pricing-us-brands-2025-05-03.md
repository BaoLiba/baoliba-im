## üìà The Cost of Hiring a YouTube Influencer in Belgium Depends on Several Factors

While the average cost of hiring a Belgian YouTube influencer in 2025 can range from $175 to $2,500 per video, several factors can influence the price.

### 1. **The Influencer‚Äôs Audience Size and Engagement Rate**

Generally, the larger the influencer's following and the higher their engagement rate, the more they can charge for their services. 

According to the same report, 76% of Belgian influencers have between 1,000 and 10,000 followers. That means most influencers in Belgium are micro-influencers with relatively smaller audiences.

This suggests that hiring a Belgian YouTube influencer on average may be more affordable than hiring someone from another country. 

### 2. **The Type of Content Requested**

The type of content you request can also affect the price. For example, a simple shoutout may cost less than a full product review or tutorial. 

### 3. **The Influencer‚Äôs Niche**

Influencers in certain niches may charge more due to their specialized knowledge and audience. For example, beauty influencers may charge more than lifestyle influencers. 

### 4. **The Influencer‚Äôs Location**

In influencer marketing, geography plays a significant role in pricing. Generally, influencers in larger cities or regions with a higher cost of living may charge more.¬†

### 5. **The Length of the Campaign**

The length of the campaign can also affect the price. For example, a one-time collaboration may cost less than a long-term partnership. 

### 6. **The Influencer's Experience and Reputation**

Influencers with more experience and a better reputation may charge more for their services.¬†

## ‚ùó YouTube Influencer Marketing May Not Be as Effective in Belgium as in Other Countries 

Although Belgium is home to many successful YouTube influencers, influencer marketing may not yield as effective results as in other countries.

According to the most recent European Social Media Influencer Survey by the Belgian influencer marketing agency, Yoors, Belgian consumers are the most skeptical of influencer marketing in Europe.

In fact, 29% of Belgian consumers do not believe influencers are trustworthy, compared to the European average of 19%. 

This skepticism is likely rooted in cultural attitudes. Belgians are known for being down-to-earth and pragmatic, which may lead them to be more discerning consumers.¬†

If you plan to hire a Belgian YouTube influencer in 2025, you may want to consider this factor when developing your marketing strategy.
