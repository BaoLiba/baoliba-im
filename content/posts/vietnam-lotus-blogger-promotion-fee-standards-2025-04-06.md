When marketing with Lotus influencers in Vietnam, it‚Äôs important to understand how they charge for their promotional collaborations. The most commonly asked question is ‚Äúhow much do Lotus influencers charge for promotional posts?‚Äù

Let's delve into the answers to that question that American brands would be asking in 2025 and communicate them to the Lotus influencers in Vietnam.


## ‚öñÔ∏è Legal Requirements to Consider When Collaborating with Lotus Influencers in Vietnam

Vietnam does not have an advertising-specific legislation that covers influencer marketing as of 2023. Instead, such activities are scattered across various laws. 

But, it is important to be aware of the overarching legislation that governs advertising in Vietnam if you are an American brand planning to promote in Vietnam through collaborations with Vietnam Lotus influencers.

The Law on Advertising 2018 defines advertising as an act to promote the purchase, sale, and use of goods and services. Therefore, for Lotus influencers to promote your brand in Vietnam, they would need to ensure that the promotion of your products or services complies with this definition.

Meanwhile, the Law on Cyber Security 2018 and the Law on Electronic Transactions focus on advertising forms that take place on the Internet, emphasizing online advertisements, and also applying to influencer marketing.

Under the scope of the Law on Cyber Security 2018, Lotus influencers are required to advertise on platforms that comply with the law. This law also outlines requirements for content, such that they are forbidden from disseminating information that endangers national security, social order and safety, etc.

The Law on Electronic Transactions, on the other hand, broadly applies to online transactions, including advertisements that result in online purchases. This law is inclusive of influencer promotions that result in sales of your goods or services through digital means.

American brands would need to be conscious of these regulations when promoting with Vietnamese Lotus influencers and ensure that their advertisements fully comply with applicable laws.


## üíµ Lotus Influencers in Vietnam Offer Packages with Fees but Charge Per Post

While Lotus influencers in Vietnam may present a package fee for their promotional collaborations, they do not actually work with packages.

The ‚Äúpackage‚Äù that they throw in your face is just one promotional post, although they might say otherwise. 

If you insist on more than one post, you can expect to pay more. Because they will ask you to pay for an ‚Äúextra post‚Äù or even two more posts or more depending on how many gimmicks they can come up with.

It‚Äôs like a Christmas turkey advertisement at Walmart. They say it‚Äôs $10, but then you find out it comes with other packages that amount to $50. 

The same is true with Lotus influencers in Vietnam. They say their promotional post is only $50, but it turns out that you would end up paying at least 2 or 3 promotional posts.

As of 2023, the basic price range for a promotional post with a Lotus influencer in Vietnam is between $20 and $50, depending on the Lotus influencer‚Äôs popularity level.

If your brand can pay higher fees, it‚Äôs also possible to pay about $200 or more for a promotional post with a top-tier Lotus influencer.

Many American brands looking to promote in Vietnam would pay at least $20 because they would know that anything lower than that is too cheap to trust.

The cheap price would raise immediate concerns that the promotional post may also come cheap in quality. 


## üëÄ What About Lotus Influencer Engagement Rates?

If you are familiar with engagement rates for Lotus influencers in Vietnam and have already done your research, you may not be impressed by what they boast of, which are usually above 2%.

Most Lotus influencers in Vietnam cannot even pull that number up. It‚Äôs common for Lotus influencers to project an average engagement rate of 3% or as high as 4% or 5%, but the reality is that they can only manage around 1% or less.

Don‚Äôt be fooled by the post likes and comments they show you on social media. Some Lotus influencers in Vietnam engage in fictive interactions with bots to inflate their engagement rate. 

Bot-generated comments like ‚Äúawesome!‚Äù or ‚Äúlove this!‚Äù do not appear to be real interactions nor do they give any real value to the promotional post.

Therefore, American brands looking to promote their products in Vietnam through Lotus influencers would need to conduct their due diligence, such as analyzing their real engagements using metrics from influencer marketing tools. 


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Lotus Influencers in Vietnam Don‚Äôt Always Deliver 

Even after you pay up to $200 for their promotional posts, you may still question if it was worth it. Because even with a Lotus influencer in Vietnam‚Äôs claim for a high follower count, many of their promotional posts don‚Äôt get to live on their social media pages for long. 

A Lotus influencer in Vietnam can pull down your promotional post the next day or a few hours later. This is because of their lack of professionalism and reliability.

They may also lack the skills and creativity to put together a satisfactory promotional post for your products and services, or they may even decide to screw you over and remove the post altogether or sabotage it with negative comments.

Lotus influencers are uninhibited by contracts and binders that may be standard for many American brands, who may always have to abide by what their legal departments say.

The reality is that Lotus influencers in Vietnam can be very spontaneous. They sometimes operate on whims and fancy, so they have the option to simply remove your promotional post whenever they feel like it.


## üîç Trust But Verify with Lotus Influencers in Vietnam

In 2025, it is still important to verify Lotus influencers in Vietnam before engaging them for promotional collaborations.

Do not be easily swayed by their stories or claims of high follower counts or engagement rates. Instead, you would have to employ influencer marketing tools that can give you insight into their real social media metrics and analytics.

Also, insist that they issue a contract that clearly outlines their obligations and deliverables for the promotional collaboration with your American brand, as well as timelines and payment schedules. 

Influencers in Vietnam, including Lotus influencers, may not always comply with contracts, but a contract is still important as it legally binds them should they breach their obligations.  

Therefore, although it may take a little more time and effort to collaborate with Lotus influencers in Vietnam, it would be worth it to ensure a successful and satisfactory promotional collaboration.
