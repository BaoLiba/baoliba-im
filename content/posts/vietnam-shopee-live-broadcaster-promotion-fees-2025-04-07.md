### üìà Level of Influence

Influencers on Shopee Live can be categorized into four main tiers based on their influence levels:

1. **Nano-influencers:** These influencers have fewer than 10,000 followers and usually charge **$30 to $100** for promotions.

   - *Nguy√™n R√¢u* (21.8k followers)
   - *T√≠n Beauty* (22.2k followers)

### üî• Engagement Rate

The audience engagement rate of an influencer is another factor that will affect their pricing. For example, an influencer with a lower number of followers but a higher engagement rate may charge more than an influencer with a larger following but a lower engagement rate.

The average engagement rate for Vietnamese Shopee Live influencers is **1%**. However, nano-influencers can have engagement rates of **5% to 15%**, while macro and mega-influencers usually have rates of **0.5% to 1%**.

### üé¨ Promotional Methods

The promotional methods used by influencers also affect their pricing. For example, Shopee Live influencers can use various promotional methods such as product reviews, giveaways, and shoutouts, among others. The more intensive the promotional method, the higher the price.

Here are the different promotional methods that Vietnamese Shopee Live influencers can employ.

1. **Promotion during Live Stream**: This method includes showcasing the product during the live stream and discussing its features and benefits. Prices typically range from **$30 to $700** depending on the influencer tier.
  
2. **Pre-recorded Video**: The influencer creates a pre-recorded video of them showcasing and discussing the product. Prices typically range from **$50 to $1,200** depending on the influencer tier.
  
3. **Photo Posts**: The influencer posts photos of themselves unboxing or using the product on their profile. Prices typically range from **$30 to $700** depending on the influencer tier.
  
4. **Giveaway**: The influencer hosts a giveaway of the product during their live stream or on their profile. Prices typically range from **$80 to $600** depending on the influencer tier.
  
5. **Combination**: The influencer combines two or more promotional methods to provide a more thorough promotion. Prices typically range from **$100 to $1,500** depending on the influencer tier.

### ‚è≥ Promotion Duration

Lastly, the duration of the promotional collaboration will also affect the pricing. For example, an influencer who promotes a product for one live stream will charge less than an influencer who promotes a product for an entire week.

3. **Weekly Promotion**: The influencer promotes the product once every day for an entire week. Prices typically range from **$500 to $1,500** depending on the influencer tier.

## ‚ùó Risks of Fraud and Scams
