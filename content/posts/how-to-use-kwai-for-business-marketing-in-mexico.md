Kwai is a Chinese short video platform that is known as Douyin in its home market. Recently, it has stepped up efforts to penetrate the global market, with Mexico being its most significant territory outside China. 

The app overtook TikTok to become the most downloaded app in Mexico on both iOS and Android in 2022. 


Unlike TikTok, which has a more mature core demographic and is widely regarded as a platform for the youth, Kwai has a more varied user base, with 49% of users over the age of 25 years. 

This mixed audience makes it a good choice for businesses looking to reach a wider cross-section of consumers. With it now ranking as one of the most popular social media platforms in Mexico, brands that fail to take advantage of this opportunity may find their competitors get ahead of them.


üì¢ What Are The Benefits Of Using Kwai For Business Marketing?


Kwai is not just cheaper to use than other social media platforms, it is also the only one that offers a financial incentive to users.

Its user engagement is higher than most platforms, with average daily engagement at around 45 minutes per user. 

In addition, over 80% of its users have declared they are willing to watch or create videos for money, making it easier for brands to get users to engage with their content.


üì¢ Using Influencers on Kwai to Promote Your Business


Business owners looking to market their brands on Kwai need to partner with influencers who are already established on the app.

Kwai influencers will already have a loyal following on the app and can help your business achieve its marketing goals. They will also be familiar with the app and its features, and how best to create content that will engage users.


üí° How to Find Influencers for Your Kwai Marketing


A quick search on Kwai using relevant keywords will help you find influencers that suit your niche. 

Influencer marketing platforms can also help you find influencers to partner with. 

These platforms allow you to create a project brief, set your budget, and then manage the entire campaign through the platform.


üìä How Much Do Kwai Influencers Charge?


The fees charged by influencers on Kwai vary widely based on their follower count, engagement rate, and the type of content they create. 

Nano influencers with only a small following of 1k-10k can charge as little as $50 per post. 

Those with a large following, above 100k, can charge anywhere from $500 to $2000 or even more.

The costs of running a successful influencer marketing campaign on Kwai will depend on the number of influencers you intend to work with and the type of content you want them to create.


üì¢ Creating Content for Your Kwai Marketing Campaign


Kwai is primarily a video platform, so any marketing you do on it will need to be video-based. 

Kwai encourages users to create videos that are candid and spontaneous. So forget about the high-production-value videos you may be used to seeing on other platforms, Kwai users want authentic and relatable content.

Brands looking to market on Kwai should remain flexible and allow influencers the freedom to create their videos as they see fit, keeping in mind that their experience and expertise will set them apart from other users. 

Kwai video content can also be live-streamed allowing influencers to engage with their audiences in real-time.

Kwai will display your ads to users that it believes are more likely to be interested in your brand based on their interests and online behavior.


‚ùó Important Considerations When Marketing Your Business on Kwai


Kwai prohibits the marketing of certain products and services and has a strict policy against inappropriate content. 

So if your business sells vaping products, gambling, or adult services, you will be limited in how you can market your brand on the app. 

You will also need to make sure that Kwai influencers adhere to these guidelines and do not post anything that violates them, as this could jeopardize your account.

üì¢ Is it Safe to Use Kwai?


Kwai has been scrutinized over user privacy and data security issues, just like many other apps in the industry. 

However, a study by NTT Security has found that Kwai has better data protection practices than its competitors.

Kwai has a clear and reasonable privacy policy and is fully compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which is the gold standard for data protection. 

The company also provides its users with security tools that can help them keep their accounts secure, including two-factor authentication (2FA).
