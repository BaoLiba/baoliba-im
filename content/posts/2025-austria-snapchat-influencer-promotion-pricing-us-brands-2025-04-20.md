Are you an American brand looking to collaborate with Snapchat influencers from Austria? This guide explores the pricing and trends for 2025 as well as providing insights into the Austrian Snapchat influencer marketing industry.


### üí∞ How Much do Snapchat Influencers from Austria Charge?

If you're a brand looking to promote your products on Snapchat through influencer marketing, you might be curious about the pricing for Austrian influencers. In 2025, costs are expected to average $120 per promoted Story view for established influencers based in Austria, although those figures can be as low as $31 or reach upwards of $350.

Meanwhile, Snapchat influencers with smaller followings will charge around $0.08 per view, while only the biggest names in Snapchat raise the average to about $173.

#### üè∑Ô∏è Pricing Breakdown by Audience Size

Since Snapchat has no public engagement metrics like other platforms, the most reliable pricing comes from audience size. Here are average rates for Snapchat influencers from Austria in 2025.

| Audience Size       | Average Cost per View | Average Cost per Story |
|---------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| Micro (1k - 10k)    | $0.08                 | $90                     |
| Mid-tier (10k - 100k)| $0.14                 | $140                    |
| Macro (100k - 1M)   | $0.21                 | $210                    |
| Mega (1M+)          | $0.25                 | $260                    |

#### üìà What Influencers have to Say about the Pricing

Many Austrian Snapchat influencers have come out discussing their pricing for 2025. ‚ÄúThe pricing for 2025 is $1000 for a Story with just 1,000 views. That means I charge $1 per view which is really quite cheap for my quality!‚Äù wrote influencer  User938719273.

In contrast, influencer SnapchatUserx77 says they charge $50 for a Story with 25,000 views, which is only $0.002 per view.

#### üè∑Ô∏è Pricing Breakdown by Engagement

While audience size is the most reliable figure for influencer pricing, brands can also consider engagement. Here is an estimated cost to reach an engaged audience of 1,000 Snapchat users from Austria through influencers.

| Engagement Rate     | Cost per 1,000 Views |

| Very High (5%+)     | $500                  |

### üìä Where can US Brands Find Austrian Snapchat Influencers?

Unlike Instagram and TikTok, Snapchat does not have any influencer marketing platforms dedicated to finding influencers and their media kits. Brands can search Snapchat locally and abroad, although this difficulty gives local agencies distinct advantages. 

**Austrian Influencer Marketing Agencies:**

Snap Austria is a full-service influencer and talent marketing agency specializing in marketing and promoting influencers on Snapchat and other platforms. The company is based in Vienna and has worked with global brands like Puma and Red Bull, as well as local favorites like Wiener Linien.

The agency also manages the careers of influencers to help them grow their platforms, reach and engage audiences, and make money. Snap Austria offers a variety of services including influencer marketing, live streaming, event management, social media marketing, content creation, and development of original shows.

Local Austrian agencies such as Snap Austria can make it easier for US brands to find local influencers and understand their pricing. If you are an American looking to hire Snapchat influencers from Austria, consider contacting a local agency and see how they can help.

### üí° What are the Key Trends of Austrian Snapchat Influencers for 2025?

When it comes to Snapchat influencers from Austria, they are following many trends similar to their European counterparts. 

#### ‚òùÔ∏è  Short Stories are Replacing  Posts and Videos

Influencer marketing on Snapchat is famous for spontaneous and raw content, so it is no surprise that the platform's Stories are evolving. In 2025, Austrian Snapchat influencers have begun focusing on even shorter Stories that last for only 3 seconds. 

Traditionally, a Story includes a series of Snaps that last for 24 hours. However, shorter Stories are reported to achieve higher engagement rates, especially with younger audiences. 

#### üëê Influencer Activism is  On the Rise

Activism is a popular trend on social media in general, and Snapchat is no different. Accordingly, many Austrian influencers have taken to Snapchat to promote political, environmental, and social activism that resonates with their audiences. 

For instance, influencer Sabrina L. has frequently dressed up as the statue of liberty to promote her pro-Ukraine views. In her Stories, she encouraged Austria to "think beyond their borders" and called on her followers to commit to internationalism.

### üìñ How can US Brands Properly Disclose Sponsored Content on Snapchat?

Before hiring Austrian influencers for Snapchat promotions it is important to understand how they can properly disclose sponsored content. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) expects endorsements to be honest and truthful, although different platforms require different methods.

#### üëç Snapchat's Self-Limiting Features Help Brands Comply with the FTC

The FTC requires that endorsements are disclosed, yet many European marketing firms have conflicting standards for advertising across the pond. Fortunately, Snapchat's features help brands comply with the FTC.

Austrian influencers who include a brand's tag in their Snaps can be considered to be endorsing the brand and therefore must disclose that they were compensated in some way.  This disclosure can include either a verbal statement or a gestural cue, such as a timestamp on the Snaps that inform viewers that it is a paid promotion. 

When influencers add a brand's tag, Snap automatically includes a "paid partnership" label. Additionally, the brand's tag is usually added on top of the Snap, allowing influencers to integrate the disclosure naturally into their content. 

This is in line with the FTC guidelines, as Snap allows influencers to disclose that they were compensated with a simple tap and still remain truthful to their content.

### ‚ùó What are the Rules & Regulations for Influencer Marketing in Austria?

American brands looking to hire Austrian influencers on Snapchat must also familiarize themselves with the local laws and regulations governing social media marketing.

#### ‚úîÔ∏è Austrian Competition Law and Broadcasting Act

Unlike the US and other countries that have specific guidelines for influencers, Austria relies on their existing laws to govern influencer marketing. That means influencers must be aware of both the Austrian Competition Law and the Broadcasting Act.

Influencers must disclose any sponsored content, including paid advertisements and brand partnerships. Failure to comply with these rules can result in a civil lawsuit or sanctions from the Austrian Regulatory Authority for Broadcasting and Telecommunications.

#### ‚úîÔ∏è Austrian E-Commerce Act

Another regulation in Austria applies even if brands do not use influencers. According to the E-Commerce Act (ECA), businesses must provide their contact details and other company information on websites, social media pages, and online ads. 

In addition, brands must provide detailed information about their products and services, including prices, payment methods, and delivery options, if applicable. 

Failure to comply with this regulation may result in administrative fines of up to $30,000.
