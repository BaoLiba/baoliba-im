Israeli companies have proven to be experts in leveraging LinkedIn for the promotion of their services and products. However, an emerging trend indicates that LinkedIn influencers from Israel are increasingly targeting American brands that wish to enhance their image in the Middle Eastern startup hub.

As we step into 2025, American companies can expect to witness an impressive return on investment when they engage Israeli influencers on LinkedIn. If you're interested in engaging these influencers to promote your US-based business on LinkedIn in Israel, you've come to the right place. This article comprehensively breaks down the various pricing models of Israeli LinkedIn influencers who target American brands.

## üìå How do Israeli LinkedIn Influencers position themselves?

Israeli LinkedIn influencers have solidified their presence on the platform as thought leaders and industry pioneers, demonstrating their expertise across diverse fields such as high-tech, social impact, and even finance. The ones that cater to American clients often embody a blend of Western eloquence and Middle Eastern charisma in their approach to communication, establishing a perfect bridge for US brands aiming to penetrate the Israeli or regional markets.

An example of a top-tier Israeli LinkedIn influencer is Deena Goren, who is not only the Director of Client Services at "Innovative cloud," a market leader in artificial intelligence and machine learning, but also the host of the highly popular podcast "THE DATA MESSIAH." She boasts over 41,000 followers on LinkedIn and utilises her substantial influence on the platform to bolster the image of American companies and technologies in Israel. 

One particular post of hers caught my eye. She expressed her admiration for the cloud technology of "Pure Storage," an American data storage company providing products and services that help organizations around the world manage digital information. In her post, she even went as far as to tag the company, stating that it should be on the radar of any modern Israeli startup. Such outreach is one of the many ways Israeli LinkedIn influencers assist American companies in establishing a foothold in the Israeli market. 

Speaking of footholds, although the Goren example leans heavily into tech startups, make no mistake that LinkedIn influencers from Israel are adept at working with companies from just about any sector, from agriculture to apparel, security to services, and big business to small enterprises. 

## üí∞ Pricing Models of Israeli LinkedIn Influencers

According to an insider source at BaoLiba, Israeli LinkedIn influencers fall into three pricing categories. Their advertising rates generally range between $1000 and $8000 per campaign or post, depending on the influencer's category. These categories include "micro-influencers," "mid-tier influencers," and "mega influencers."

### Micro-influencers

These Israeli influencers have between 5,000 and 15,000 followers, charging an average of $1,000 per campaign or post.

### Mid-tier Influencers

These Israeli influencers have between 15,000 and 100,000 followers, charging an average of $4,000 per campaign or post.

### Mega Influencers

These Israeli influencers have over 100,000 followers, charging an average of $8,000 per campaign or post.

While the figures I‚Äôve provided are averages, take note that micro-influencers may charge as little as $400, while mega influencers may charge as much as $15,000. 

Perhaps more importantly is that the better the influencer, the greater the chance that they will deliver a guaranteed number of impressions. In fact, many top-performing Israeli LinkedIn influencers can deliver hundreds of thousands of impressions per post. 

## üìâ Why such pricing disparity?

As with any influencer marketing platform, there exists a substantial difference between the pricing of one influencer versus another. However, the disparity in pricing among Israeli LinkedIn influencers can largely be attributed to three factors: follower engagement rate, post virality, and influencer reputation.

### Follower Engagement Rate

This statistic indicates how actively an influencer's followers engage with their content. It is computed by dividing the total engagement (likes, comments, shares) by the total number of followers and multiplying by 100. 

As a general rule, the higher the engagement rate, the more valuable the influencer to advertisers. Lesser-known Israeli influencers may have a follower count of 100,000, but if their engagement rate lingers around 1% or lower, they may not get a second glance from advertisers who are conscious of ROI.

### Post Virality

Post virality essentially captures the extent to which a post travels beyond one's own followers. It is a measure of how often an influencer's content gets shared or recommended.

For instance, an Israeli CEO boasting 200,000 followers may only receive a 1,000 impressions for every post they create. In stark contrast, an Israel software engineer with only 30,000 followers may consistently earn 200,000 impressions per post. 

### Influencer Reputation

A reputation for delivering high-quality content and exceeding client expectations can significantly enhance an influencer's appeal, leading them to command higher prices. 

This is why it is critical to work with reputable marketing platforms, such as BaoLiba, to source the best Israeli LinkedIn influencers that can ensure you‚Äôre getting value for your spend.

## üìä Higher Engagement Rates on LinkedIn

When comparing the engagement rates of LinkedIn influencers against those on Instagram and TikTok, LinkedIn consistently outperforms the competition. According to a survey conducted by Hootsuite, LinkedIn influencers can boast an impressive average engagement rate of around 2.7%. 

When compared to other platforms, consider the following average engagement rates: 

- Instagram: 2.0%
- Facebook: 0.10%
- Twitter: 0.50%

Also according to Hootsuite, LinkedIn is rated the top platform for B2B marketing, with 77% of B2B marketers considering it the best social channel for generating leads. 

Not only that, according to Wishpond, LinkedIn is responsible for 80% of B2B leads from social media. So, not only are Israeli LinkedIn influencers more effective than their counterparts on other platforms, more American brands can leverage their effectiveness to generate those lucrative leads.

## üîç Finding Israeli LinkedIn Influencers

Similar to other types of influencer marketing, finding the right Israeli LinkedIn influencer for your needs can prove to be a daunting task. However, influencer marketing platforms can simplify the process of finding and sourcing them. 

While marketing platforms such as BuzzSumo and Stacked Marketers can locate influencers across multiple platforms, they fail to conduct thorough vetting processes and often lack access to many top-tier influencers. 

Instead, consider working with BaoLiba, the world‚Äôs leading influencer marketing platform. BaoLiba has access to a massive pool of reputable Israeli LinkedIn influencers, utilizing cutting-edge technology to match American brands with those influencers that are the best fit for their needs.
