In recent years, Southeast Asia has risen from obscurity to prominence as a global leader in social media content creation. In a recent report from market research firm MediaKix, Thailand is projected to have the highest per capita users of YouTube in the world by 2025.

By 2025, Thailand will not only boast a remarkable 90 million users, but also 134 million total accounts on the platform. Considering that Thailand has a population of only 69 million, that breaks down to nearly two accounts for every Thai national.

As the number of consumers streaming videos online climbs worldwide, brands have been flocking to influencer marketing, which is projected to grow 28% year-on-year through 2030.

Given the staggering penetration rates for YouTube in Thailand, it's only natural that many Western brands would seek partnerships with Thai influencers to promote their businesses in 2025.

There are a variety of factors that determine influencer pricing across different cultures. Understanding these distinctions will give your brand the edge when negotiating YouTube influencer pricing with Thai talent.

### üìà Pricing Models

When negotiating influencer promotions in Thailand, it's important to keep in mind that influencers work under several different pricing models.

The most common pricing models for Thai influencers include:

- **Cost Per Post**
- **Cost Per Engagement**
- **Cost Per Click**
- **Cost Per Acquisition**

Each model has its own unique advantages and disadvantages. Let's take a closer look at each.

#### Cost Per Post

The cost per post model is the simplest, and as such is also the most widely used. Under this model, influencers will charge brands a flat fee to create and distribute posts on their YouTube channel. 

Pricing under the cost per post model can vary significantly, depending on the experience, reach and quality of the influencer. 

Typical costs per post for Thai YouTube influencers range from $100 to $20,000 each. However, larger influencers can often charge $60,000 or more for a single sponsored post.

#### Cost Per Engagement

In Thailand, the cost per engagement (CPE) model is a popular alternative to simply charging a flat fee per post. 

Under this model, influencers will charge brands a fee based on the number of consumer engagements created in response to their promotional content. 

Engagements can include a variety of customer actions, including comments, likes, shares and even purchases. 

CPE pricing can vary widely based on the influencer. Average pricing may fall between $0.10 to $2.00 per engagement. Using these averages, an influencer could charge $1,000 for 500 engagements, or $10,000 for 5,000 engagements. 

#### Cost Per Click

The cost per click (CPC) model is another popular option, particularly among tech influencers. 

Using the CPC model, an influencer will charge brands a fee for each actual click delivered to a designated link in the influencer‚Äôs post. 

This model can be particularly useful for brands promoting downloadable content or eCommerce websites, as CPC pricing corresponds directly with the business‚Äôs bottom line. 

Typical pricing for Thai YouTube influencers under the CPC model may fall between $0.25 to $1.50 per click.

#### Cost Per Acquisition

The cost per acquisition (CPA) model is similar to the CPC model, but generally has a much higher price point. 

While a CPC fee might reflect each click delivered, a CPA fee will instead reflect each successful conversion achieved through the influencer‚Äôs promotional efforts.

A conversion may include any specified consumer action, such as newsletter sign-ups, quote requests or product purchases.

Given that it corresponds directly to a brand‚Äôs sales, the CPA model is often the most desirable pricing model. In Thailand, CPA pricing can occur at rates of $20 to $250 or more per conversion.

### üìù Creators' Tips

Regardless of the pricing model used, YouTube influencers in Thailand generally follow a similar process for delivering their promotional services. 

Let‚Äôs break down the steps most creators will follow when partnering with brands on YouTube.

1. **Introductory Call**: The first step in working with a creator is typically an introductory call. During this call, businesses and influencers will discuss the specifics of the promotion, such as deadlines, requirements and pay rates. 

2. **Script Development**: Once the details of the sponsorship are agreed upon, the influencer will begin developing a script for their promotional content. 

3. **Script Approval**: After the influencer has developed a preliminary script, they will send it to the brand for approval. Many influencers will not begin production until script approval has been received. 

4. **Content Creation**: Once the script has been approved, the influencer will move into production mode, filming and editing their promotional content. 

5. **Submission for Review**: After the influencer has completed their promotional content, they will submit it to the brand for review. 

6. **Content Publishing**: Upon brand approval, the influencer will publish their promotional content to their YouTube channel.

### üíµ Payment Methods

Once a Thai influencer has completed a promotion, it's time to settle payment. 

In Thailand, many influencers will require payment to be sent via bank transfer. However, there are also several other options for online payment that can work for both brands and influencers. 

Some popular payment services for cross-border payments in Thailand include:

- **Wise**: Wise is a popular service for making international money transfers. Wise allows users to send money via bank transfer, credit card or even cryptocurrency. 

- **Payoneer**: Payoneer is another popular online payment service. Payoneer allows brands to send payments to Thai influencers via bank transfer or debit card.

- **PayPal**: PayPal is another popular option, although there can sometimes be issues with compatibility when making cross-border payments into Thailand.

### üë©‚Äçüíº Thai Agency Bidding Practices

When hiring Thai influencers through an agency, brands should expect to pay higher prices than they would when going directly through the influencer's management.

It's not uncommon for influencers at an agency to charge upwards of four times their normal rates for brands that connect with them through an agency.

There are several reasons for this price increase. First, most agencies will charge a fee for their services, often resulting in inflated pricing from the influencer to cover those fees.

In addition, agencies will often require that influencers pay a fee to be featured on their roster. This also results in higher prices being charged by the influencer.

### üìÖ 2025 Pricing Predictions

As influencer marketing continues to grow in popularity, it's likely that influencer pricing will also increase in 2025.

In Thailand, we can expect to see the following average prices for YouTube influencer marketing:

- **Cost Per Post:** $500 to $35,000
- **Cost Per Engagement:** $0.15 to $2.50
- **Cost Per Click:** $0.50 to $2.00
- **Cost Per Acquisition:** $25 to $350

### ‚ùó Risks of Cross-Border Payments

There are several advantages to hiring influencers from Thailand for promotional campaigns. Unfortunately, there are also some inherent risks.

Cross-border payments come with the possibility of increased fraud risk and chargebacks. 

To circumvent several of these payment risks, brands should consider hiring influencers from Thailand through platforms that specialize in influencer marketing.

By hiring influencers through a platform, brands will not only mitigate payment risks, but also streamline the entire influencer marketing process.


### üöÄ Power on the Platforms

When partnering with Thai influencers, brands should strongly consider working with an influencer marketing platform. 

These platforms will help facilitate negotiations, contracts and payments between brands and influencers, reducing hassle across the entire influencer marketing process. 

Plus, many influencer marketing platforms have experts in influencer marketing who can help guide brands through the entire campaign.

### üéØ SEO Triggers

When working with Thai influencers, brands should consider understanding some SEO triggers that Thai influencers may incorporate into their promotional content. 

These SEO triggers can help to ensure the success of the promotional campaign and boost visibility across YouTube. 

Some popular SEO triggers that Thai influencers can use include:

- **Localized Keywords**: One way influencers can trigger SEO is through the use of localized keywords. Keywords that are geographically relevant to the target audience can help increase the chances of content reaching consumers.

- **Long-Tail Keywords**: Along with localized keywords, influencers can improve SEO through the use of long-tail keywords. Long-tail keywords are phrases consisting of three or more words that are more specific than generic keywords. Long-tail keywords will help influencers capture a more targeted audience.

- **Video Tags**: When uploading a video to YouTube, influencers will have the option to add various tags that describe their content. By adding relevant tags, influencers can help boost their content‚Äôs chances of appearing in search results. 

### üßß Culturally Sensitive Content

When partnering with influencers from Thailand, it's important to remain sensitive to local customs. 

In Thai culture, it‚Äôs considered taboo to display the soles of your feet. When filming promotional content, influencers should avoid displaying their feet, particularly when seated. 

In addition, the thumbs-up gesture is often interpreted in Thailand as an insult. Instead, influencers should use the ‚Äúpeace‚Äù sign as their go-to hand gesture. 

When working with Thai influencers, brands and their representatives should ensure that all promotional content respects local customs and traditions.
