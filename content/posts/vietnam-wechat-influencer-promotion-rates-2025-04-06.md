In the sprawling digital landscape of marketing, platforms evolve and trends shift. As of 2025, Vietnamese influencers are making waves on a platform many Western brands may overlook‚ÄîWeChat.

WeChat, a widely-used messaging app in China, is quickly gaining traction among Vietnamese influencers targeting Chinese consumers. 

If you‚Äôre looking to expand your brand into the Chinese market, we‚Äôre breaking down everything you need to know when collaborating with Vietnamese WeChat influencers.

## üåé Vietnamese WeChat Influencers Are the Bridge to the Chinese Market

Thanks to its exposure to the Chinese market, Vietnam has seen a boom in WeChat popularity over the past five years. 

In fact, WeChat is the most popular social media app among Vietnamese users, who reportedly comprise 20% of the platform's total users. 

According to a 2022 survey by Statista, Vietnam comes in second after China for global WeChat users, surpassing India and the United States.

## üìù Why Vietnamese Influencers Are Your Best Bet

Vietnam‚Äôs booming WeChat user base isn‚Äôt the only reason your brand should work with Vietnamese influencers.

A 2023 article by Marketing Interactive notes that despite Chinese brands taking up the lion's share of the Vietnamese cosmetic market, Vietnamese consumers prefer local brands. This means your brand will be competing against popular Chinese cosmetics brands to win over the hearts of Vietnamese consumers.

Conversely, Vietnamese WeChat influencers already have built-in trust and credibility among their followers. With their help, your brand can quickly and effectively penetrate the Chinese market.

## üî¢ Pricing for Vietnamese WeChat Influencers

Like any other influencer, the cost for collaborating with Vietnamese WeChat influencers varies based on several key factors.

Prices for WeChat influencer marketing can range from **$50 to $2,000 per post.** 

However, most brands can expect to pay between **$100 and $600 per post** for a standard collaboration.

**Type of Content:** 
- Promotional text posts on WeChat can start at around **$50**.
- A series of images may push the cost to **$500**.
- Videos and live streams command the highest fees, often reaching **$2,000**.

**Follower Count:** 
As in many regions, the larger the influencer's audience, the higher the fees. 

WeChat influencers with 10,000 to 50,000 followers typically charge **$100 to $400** per post, while those with over 200,000 followers charge **$600 to $1,500**.

**Level of Engagement:** 
Brands may find it worth the investment to work with influencers with a smaller reach but high engagement rates. 

According to Daniel D, a Vietnamese influencer marketing expert and founder of Goc Media, the best WeChat influencers have engagement rates between **10% and 25%**.

## üè¶ Payment Terms

Brands can typically expect to pay **50% upfront** before the collaboration begins, with the remaining balance paid upon completion of the campaign. 

WeChat influencers usually prefer to be paid in Chinese currency, the **RMB**. 

Some common payment methods include:
- **WeChat Pay**: The most popular payment method in Asia is the preferred method for Vietnamese influencers.
- **Alipay**: This is another popular payment app in Asia that Vietnamese influencers will accept. 
- **PayPal**: Popular among American brands, this method is only accepted by some WeChat influencers, so it‚Äôs best to confirm beforehand.

## ‚ùó Legalese

One major benefit of working with Vietnamese influencers compared to those from other regions is the legal safety net over international contracts.

Vietnamese civil law provides a clearer way to settle disputes involving foreign entities with businesses in Vietnam.

According to the **2023 Vietnam Business Law Handbook** by USA International Press, **Chapter 2** outlines several ways foreign entities can do business in Vietnam.

To settle disputes, both the Vietnamese influencer and American brand can agree beforehand to abide by either local or foreign laws, and settle in either Vietnamese courts or international arbitration.

This provides a safety net for both parties, protecting the rights of both the influencer and the brand. 

## üîó How to Find Vietnamese WeChat Influencers

Working with WeChat influencers may seem daunting since much of the influencer marketing community centers around Instagram and TikTok. 

Fortunately, influencer marketing platforms are popping up across Asia, and many include WeChat influencers in their databases.
