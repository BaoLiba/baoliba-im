In Finland, Facebook influencers are expected to charge US brands between $378 and $1,139 in 2025. 

Although this represents a considerable decrease from the average price of $962 in 2024, Finland‚Äôs Facebook influencers are still poised to earn a premium for their promotional work in 2025.

A spokesperson for the Finland-based influencer marketing agency, BaoLiba, stated that Finnish Facebook influencers are justified in charging US brands a higher price for their promotional work given the unique cultural differences between the two countries.

As a result, US brands will need to be cautious when negotiating promotional deals with Finland-based Facebook influencers in 2025 to ensure they are paying a fair price.

### ü§ë 2025 average costs for promoting US brands on Finnish Facebook accounts

The following table summarizes the average costs of promoting US brands on Finnish Facebook accounts in 2025. 

| Promotion Type | Average Cost (USD) |
| -------------- | ------------------- |
| Single Post    | $378                |
| 3-Post Package | $1,139              |
| Total          | $1,517              |

In the table above, we can see that the average price for a single promotional post on Facebook is $378. When purchasing a package of three promotional posts, the average price increases significantly to $1,139. 

Combined, these promotional packages cost an average of $1,517 per promotion. 

According to the BaoLiba spokesperson, the low average price of $378 for a single promotional post is concerning. 

‚ÄúWhile our agency does not discourage influencers from setting competitive prices to attract brands, we caution that low prices may devalue the influencer marketing industry in Finland. US brands should expect to pay premium prices for promotional work on Finnish Facebook accounts, given the high quality of work they deliver,‚Äù the spokesperson said.

### ü§≥ 2025 average follower count for Finnish Facebook influencers

| 50K - 100K     | 13%                       |
| 100K - 500K    | 14%                       |

‚ÄúDespite the fact that most Finnish Facebook influencers have relatively small follower counts, many are still able to earn a lucrative income by charging premium prices for their promotional work. In comparison, we can see from the statistics that many influencers in other countries have a higher percentage of influencers that fall into the 500K to 1M follower count range. However, many of them are unable to monetize their accounts as effectively,‚Äù the spokesperson stated.

### üó®Ô∏è What are some tips for negotiating with Finnish Facebook influencers?

The following are some tips for negotiating with Finland-based Facebook influencers when organizing promotional campaigns for US brands.

#### üí¨ Avoid mentioning that you are from the US

Mentioning that you are from the US may lead Finnish Facebook influencers to believe they can charge you a higher price for their promotional work.

#### üí¨ Make an initial offer that is lower than your target price

When negotiating with Finnish Facebook influencers, it is best to make an initial offer that is lower than your target price.

#### üí¨ Be willing to walk away from the deal

If a Finnish Facebook influencer refuses to accept your price, be willing to walk away from the deal. 

This will demonstrate that your price is non-negotiable and may prompt the influencer to reconsider your offer. 

If the influencer still refuses to accept your price after you have walked away from the deal, you can always follow up with a message stating your willingness to proceed if they change their mind.
