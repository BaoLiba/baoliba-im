Discovering the right influencer to collaborate with can be challenging. If your brand is looking to leverage a Chinese influencer to promote your product on WeChat, you probably want to know how much you should be paying for their services.

### üí∞How Much Does a WeChat Influencer Collaboration Cost?

Expect to spend an average of $500 to $16,000 (3,500 to 110,000 yuan) to promote your product through WeChat influencers. The amount you ultimately pay depends on the influencer‚Äôs follower count, contents of the collaboration, and engagement metrics.

It‚Äôs important to note that prices can also vary significantly from one influencer to another, so feel free to negotiate. 


### üìàAverage Pricing per Sponsored Post

| Tier | Follower Count | Average Price |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Nano  | 1K-10K | $500 - $3,000 |
| Micro | 10K-100K | $3,000 - $8,000 | 
| Mid-Tier | 100K-500K | $8,000 - $16,000 | 
| Macro | 500K and above | $16,000 and up | 

#### Most WeChat Influencer Collaborations Are Priced Per Post

Most WeChat influencer promotions are charged on a per post basis. A single post on a WeChat account can reach anywhere from 20% to 90% of an influencer‚Äôs total followers, meaning views can be quite substantial.

Additionally, engaging content is likely to be shared widely, allowing your product to reach an even broader audience. Considering the high potential return on investment, it‚Äôs not surprising that most influencers charge per post.


#### Factors Influencers Consider When Pricing Collaborations

Here are a few of the metrics influencers take into account when determining how much to charge for their post:

- **Engagement Rate**: This refers to the average number of likes, shares, and comments the influencer receives from their followers. A higher engagement score generally equates to a higher price.

- **Target Audience**: The more niche the influencer‚Äôs audience, the more they will likely charge for a post. For example, an influencer who only targets mothers is likely to charge more than one who targets just anyone.

- **Influencer Rating**: This refers to the level of the influencer‚Äôs authority within their industry. For example, a macro influencer who works with a lot of popular brands like Puma will likely charge more for a sponsorship than a macro influencer who only collaborates with small startups. 


### üè¶ How WeChat Influencers Prefer to Get Paid

WeChat operates similarly to Stripe or PayPal, where users can send and receive payments. WeChat Wallet is the app‚Äôs payment platform that allows for money transfers. Cultural and market differences mean that influencer collaborations in China largely rely on user friendly payment apps like WeChat Wallet and Alipay.

When collaborating with Chinese influencers, expect them to request payment through either of these two channels before they publish their post. Wire transfers are also an alternative payment method, but they may come with higher fees and take longer to process. 

#### Minimum and Maximum Payments per WeChat Transaction

WeChat has set a minimum transfer limit of 1 yuan, not including transaction fees. A maximum transaction limit applies to all users, regardless of how long they've had an account. 

Newer WeChat accounts are limited to transferring only 1,000 yuan (or about $150) per transaction and can only send 2,000 yuan in total per day.

More established accounts are allowed to send 2,000 yuan (about $290) per transaction and up to 5,000 yuan per day. 

Companies that want to transfer more than the daily limits can contact WeChat‚Äôs customer support for a business account. Business accounts have higher limits, allowing them to send larger amounts at a time.

### ü§ù WeChat Influencers Usually Have No Contractual Obligations 

Most WeChat influencers are not bound by contracts. When they agree to collaborate, it‚Äôs often through a casual conversation rather than a legally binding agreement.

This means that you may not get what you asked for even after paying the influencer. For example, the influencer may promise to include a link to your company‚Äôs webpage in their post, but ultimately forget to do so because it slipped their mind. 

Since everything that happens is based loosely on trust, it‚Äôs important to communicate your requirements clearly to the influencer you decide to collaborate with. 

### üìù More Complex WeChat Collaborations Can Cost More

While most WeChat influencers charge per post, more complex collaborations may be charged differently. For example, if your collaboration requires multiple posts spread out over a week, the influencer is likely to charge you one lump sum to cover all the posts. 

Prices for the following more intricate WeChat promotions can vary widely:

- **Multiple Posts/Series**: If the influencer agrees to compose more than one post over a specific timeframe, they may charge a flat rate for all the posts together. 

- **Product Reviews**: Influencers who offer in-depth product reviews may charge more than what they typically charge for a simple post. 

- **Video Posts**: WeChat video posts can attract a lot of views, so influencers may charge a premium for these types of collaborations. 


### üìä Why Brands Should Consider WeChat Influencer Collaborations

There are many reasons why brands should consider WeChat influencer marketing, including:

- **Large User Base**: Over 1.3 billion people use WeChat. The app is especially popular among middle-class people aged 25 to 45. 

- **High Engagement**: Over 50% of WeChat users check the app daily, and more than 20% open it over ten times per day. 

- **Versatility**: WeChat is a multi-functional app that combines social media, shopping, payments, news, and customer service. This means there‚Äôs multiple ways that brands can leverage WeChat to reach their audience.


### üí° Tips for Collaborating with WeChat Influencers

Here are some tips to help you get the most out of your WeChat influencer collaboration:

- **Be Clear About Terms**: Clearly outline your expectations for the collaboration, including all necessary details. Specify if you want the influencer to include a link to your company‚Äôs webpage or post a specific number of times. 

- **Choose Influencers with Authentic Followers**: Not all followers are genuine. By checking the influencer‚Äôs profile carefully, you can get a sense of their authenticity. They are more likely to be legitimate if they regularly engage with their followers and respond to comments. 

- **Consider Mid-Tier Influencers**: Mid-tier influencers often charge significantly less than macro influencers while providing almost the same level of benefits. 

### üîçConclusion

WeChat remains one of the most influential marketing platforms in China, with over 1 billion users regularly engaging with influencers on the app. The average cost of an influencer promotion through WeChat ranges from $500 to $16,000, depending on various factors. 

If you‚Äôre looking to raise awareness of your brand through a WeChat influencer collaboration, being aware of the typical pricing structure can help you set your budget and ensure you‚Äôre getting a good deal.
