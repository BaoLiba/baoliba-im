## üì£ The State of Influencer Marketing in Sweden
The 2025 influencer marketing landscape in Sweden looks bright for marketers.

The influencer marketing industry is expected to grow by over 12% in Sweden this year, reaching around $4 billion.

This is on par with the growth rates of the last several years.

Increased spending on social media marketing, changing consumer behavior, and the growing value of peer recommendations are largely driving this growth.

As the industry matures, established players and newcomers alike will need to adapt to the unique characteristics of the market in order to succeed, including working with local influencers, creating culturally relevant content, and knowing which channels to focus on.

In fact, Sweden has a unique influencer landscape compared to other European nations. Much of it is tied to an organic growth trajectory driven by local brands.

This is largely due to the success of homegrown influencer marketing agency, Nordic Influencers.

Founded in 2013, Nordic Influencers boasts a roster of over 70 influencers‚Äîall local, all Swedish.

They have redefined what influencer marketing means in Sweden by building a well-respected marketing platform that connects brands with Swedish influencers.

## ‚ùó Why Influencer Marketing is Different in Sweden
Sweden is becoming increasingly aware of the unique needs of the American advertising market.

Similarly, American brands that want to work with influencers in Sweden cannot expect to apply the same strategies that work domestically.

Here are three significant differences to be aware of:

### 1. More Meaningful Relationships With Audiences
Swedes appreciate sincerity and authenticity.

They are skeptical of overly polished, overproduced content. This applies to influencer marketing as well.

Brands and influencers alike that prioritize meaningful relationships over superficial connections will have more success in Sweden.

### 2. Emphasis on Community-Driven Content
While American audiences are leaning more heavily into reality television and scandal-driven storytelling, Swedes are moving in the opposite direction, seeking more community-driven and humane storytelling.

Brands that are earnest about contributing positively to their communities will find a receptive Swedish audience.

### 3. Influencer Marketing is Heavily Regulated
In Sweden, influencer marketing is taken seriously.

In fact, Sweden‚Äôs Advertising Ombudsman, a self-regulatory agency for the advertising industry, has strict guidelines in place for influencer marketing.

The guidelines make clear that all sponsored content must be clearly identifiable as advertising.

**Swedish law requires three things of sponsored content:**

- The audience must be aware that it is marketing
- It must be clearly distinguished from the rest of the content
- The distinction must be easy to see and understand

This means following the rules to the letter in Sweden. Failure to comply can result in serious penalties.

## üì¢ How to Find Swedish YouTube Influencers
Many brands may be tempted to reach out through YouTube.

However, this is often a bad strategy. Most influencers do not have the time to check every message sent through YouTube, resulting in brands missing out on potential partnerships.

Instead, use social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, or Facebook, all of which allow for more opportunities to connect with influencers directly.

However, the smartest way for brands to connect with influencers is through an influencer marketing agency.

Agencies help streamline the entire process, saving brands time and guaranteeing that they are working with reputable influencers.

Here are just a few top influencer marketing agencies in Sweden:

### 1. Nordic Influencers
Nordic Influencers is Sweden‚Äôs leading influencer marketing agency. Founded in 2013, the company has over 70 local influencers on their roster.

They are known for their professionalism, adaptability, and commitment to delivering results for brands.

### 3. Social Media College

They have a vast network of influencers in Sweden and the Nordic region. Their education offerings help ensure that influencers are knowledgeable and professional.

## üí° How Much Do YouTube Influencers Cost in Sweden?

- Nano influencers (1,000 - 10,000 followers): $500
- Micro influencers (10,000 - 100,000 followers): $900
- Middle influencers (100,000 - 500,000 followers): $1,600
