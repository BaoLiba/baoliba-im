What would it cost to hire an influencer on the Mobage platform? 

Japanese influencer marketing, especially within gaming apps, tends to be less transparent than other countries. 

Yet Mobage influencers are some of the most sought-after contributors in Japan, and their rates are comparable to Instagram and Tiktok influencers across the globe, so we broke it down for you.

## üéÆ Mobage Marketing Influencer Basics
First, we need to familiarize ourselves with the Mobage app. 

Mobage has been one of the leading social gaming apps in Japan since its launch in 2010. 

In 2018, it was reported that Mobage had around 22 million monthly active users. 

Operating on both traditional PCs and mobile devices, the app‚Äôs stated goal is to develop a ‚ÄúGame Network Platform‚Äù that encourages social interaction while playing games.

Mobage boasts eight major game genres: card games, board games, RPGs, simulation games, action games, sports games, puzzle games, and miscellaneous games, with card games making up the vast majority of Mobage‚Äôs game catalog.

While competition in the mobile gaming-as-a-service market increases, Mobage remains a significant player in Japan‚Äôs mobile gaming ecosystem.

## ü§î What is a Mobage Influencer?
Mobage influencers can be defined as popular Mobage players who attract a strong following due to their expertise or impressive performance in the game. 

Mobage influencers can be players or personalities that gain followers through social media accounts linked to their Mobage gameplay.

Mobage influencers can also be a variety of other contributors, from content creators on Tiktok, Youtube, or Twitch, who upload Mobage gameplay, to gamers and bloggers who tweet about their favorite Mobage games.

## üìä Mobage Influencer Pricing Estimates
According to the most recent data gathered in late 2023, Mobage influencers charge from $200 to over $1,000 for basic promotional content, with many additional upsell options. 

In general, the more complex the game, the more expensive the influencer marketing rates. 

A straightforward game like cache will bring influencer marketing rates down to about $200, while simulations can go over $1,000.
