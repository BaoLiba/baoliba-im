The announcement just came down from the top brass at Baoliba that 2025 will be the year of the Thailand LinkedIn influencer promo blitz for American brands.

Please allow me to elaborate.


## üåç 2025 is the Year of Thailand LinkedIn Influencer Campaigns for US Brands

If 2023 was the year of Instagram Reels, and 2024 was TikTok Lives, then 2025 will be the year of LinkedIn influencer campaigns for American brands wanting to promote their products to Thailand professionals through their LinkedIn feeds.

With the rise of LinkedIn celebrity like Raffy Alcraft, more Thai professionals are open to the idea of using their LinkedIn pages for influencer promotion on behalf of brands.

LinkedIn influencer marketing is still an infant industry in Thailand, but it‚Äôs slated to explode in popularity.


## üìà The Rise of LinkedIn Influencer Marketing in Thailand

According to a recent poll conducted by LinkedIn, 79% of Thailand respondents claimed they wanted more influencer marketing on LinkedIn, making Thailand the country with the most appetite for it in the world.

‚ÄúInfluencers have proven to effectively engage, inspire, entertain, and educate their audiences. So, it is not surprising that people are looking to them for help in their career journeys. This shift from influencer marketing primarily utilized for B2C and brand building will soon dominate B2B marketing strategies,‚Äù said Judith D. Ebrill, LinkedIn Thailand‚Äôs Country Manager.

Consistent with the rise of Thailand influencer marketing in general, Thailand LinkedIn influencer campaigns are expected to explode in popularity in the next few years.


## üé® Types of Thailand LinkedIn Influencer Promotions

There are currently three popular types of Thailand LinkedIn influencer promotions.

These include:

1. **Sponsored Posts**: Thailand LinkedIn influencers write and share posts that mention the brand and promote its product with a call to action.

2. **Influencer Articles**: Thailand LinkedIn influencers write and share articles on behalf of the brand that promote the brand‚Äôs product with a call to action.

3. **Comments on Posts**: Thailand LinkedIn influencers share posts on their timeline and comment on posts shared in their network, offering comments that promote the brand's product.

Each of these types of promotions has its own pricing scheme that will be discussed later.


## üí∞ Thailand LinkedIn Influencer Promotions Pricing for USA Brands

At this time, Thailand LinkedIn influencer marketing is not being done by very many influencers, and most of the ones doing it have been doing it for free.

As Thailand LinkedIn influencer marketing grows, so will the prices.

Currently, Thailand LinkedIn influencers charge as little as $10 and as much as $800 to promote US brands through their LinkedIn profiles.


## üìã Pricing Breakdown of Thailand LinkedIn Influencer Promotions

The price a Thailand LinkedIn influencer will charge for promotion varies based on four main criteria:

1. **Reputation**: How influential the influencer is and how much they are liked by their followers. Think of it as a combination of a popularity contest and a talent show. Most of the time, influencers have to endure the tedious process of building their reputation over years of consistent effort or overnight through a viral stunt or event. 

2. **Engagement Rate**: How many followers regularly engage with the influencer‚Äôs posts through likes, comments, and shares. Just like how restaurants and hotels are rated by how many customers actually walk through their doors compared to how many are advertised to, engagement rates are a measure of how much of an influencer‚Äôs audience is actually engaged with their content. 

3. **Promotion Type**: What type of promotion is requested by the US brand. Will it be a sponsored post, a LinkedIn article, or comments on posts? Each will have different levels of popularity among influencers, engagement rates, and time and effort invested, and will therefore have a different price attached to it.

4. **Influencer Marketing Agency**: Most influencers work with an influencer marketing agency that has more bargaining power when it comes to product promotion deals. Agencies tend to get the lion‚Äôs share of the payment, but they also do the heavy lifting of dealing with brands and negotiating.

Here is a rough pricing estimate for each promotion type based on the four criteria listed above:

- **Sponsored Posts**: $200 to $800
- **Influencer Articles**: $500 to $1,500
- **Comments on Posts**: $10 to $50 

At this time, more brands seem to be opting for comments on posts though that will likely change as more Thailand LinkedIn influencers realize their worth.

Thailand LinkedIn influencer promotions can be handled in a few different ways that parallel how other social media influencer marketing promotions are conducted.


## üé§ How Thailand LinkedIn Influencer Promotions Will Be Executed

There are three main ways that promotions can be handled. 

These are:

1. **Directly Between Brand and Influencer**: This is likely the most common practice in Thailand LinkedIn influencer marketing. Brands simply DM the influencer they want to work with on LinkedIn and work out a deal.

2. **Influencer Marketing Platforms**: In this case, both the influencer and the brand sign up with an influencer marketing platform that connects brands with influencers to arrange promotions.

3. **Influencer Marketing Agencies**: Much like an influencer marketing platform, the influencer and the brand deal with an influencer marketing agency, but the influencer marketing agency will directly handle negotiations with the brand and influencer.

The first method is the most common since Thailand LinkedIn influencers have not yet realized that they can charge brands for promotions and negotiating promotions is relatively easy and informal on LinkedIn.  

However, as discussed earlier, more Thailand LinkedIn influencers are realizing their worth and are now charging brands for promotions.

By 2025, this kind of promotion will become more formalized and professionalized.


## üìÖ The Future of Thailand LinkedIn Influencer Marketing

In the next few years, Thailand LinkedIn influencer marketing will explode in popularity among both Thailand influencers and US brands.

Just like the other forms of influencer marketing that took off in Thailand before it, such as TikTok and Instagram influencer marketing, Thai influencers who are using LinkedIn right now are expecting to cash in on their efforts.
