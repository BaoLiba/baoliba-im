Exploring Greece in every season and all its beauty is something every individual would desire.

From its pristine beaches to olive and lavender fields to islands, Greece is a dream destination for everyone. 

When it comes to travel, the images that provoke the spirit of adventure in us are often driven by social media influencers.

Instagram is probably one of the most popular platforms that social media influencers use to promote destinations, and with Greece in mind, the costs of such promotions are quite notable. 

Greece is a country that sees a high volume of international tourism, and as individuals worldwide plan their future travels, it's important to cap on the growing interest in travel to Greece. 

If you are a brand or business from the USA and want to promote your services in Greece, partnering with local Instagram influencers is a wise investment. 

Most brands prefer to partner with local influencers rather than flying in their influencers, as this proves to be a more cost-effective and authentic promotion. 

As you plan your brand's marketing efforts, here is what you can expect to spend on influencer marketing in Greece in 2025.

## üåç What Influencers are Posting

When it comes to travel, the posts that attract the most engagement are the stunning visuals. 

When promoting destinations, Instagram influencers usually post captivating images of the destination they are promoting and caption with the best features of the location, such as its history, cuisine, culture, or lifestyle.

More videos are being posted across social media. When promoting travel, videos tend to consume a greater amount of engagement than static images, and Instagram influencer marketing campaigns are trending towards short-form videos over images. 

Short videos are those that are less than a minute, and influencers are encouraged to create content that is more engaging than the typical travel video. 

Travel videos that highlight the beauty of the destination are usually a collection of short videos showcasing the best moments that are unique to that location.

In Greece, engaging content is what you can expect from the influencers. 


## ‚úâÔ∏è How to connect with influencers in Greece

When planning your influencer marketing campaign in Greece, it would be beneficial to create an influencer brief. 

An influencer brief is a guideline that outlines your brand‚Äôs goals and expectations, as well as what type of influencers you are looking to partner with.

With the brief ready, you can start searching for influencers in Greece. 

A few methods you can use to search for influencers in Greece:

## üíº Payment Types

When partnering with influencers in Greece, you can expect to pay in different ways. In the majority of influencer campaigns, the influencers expect to receive assets, which may include free products and services from your brand.

For example, if you own a hotel in Greece, you can offer free stays at your hotel in exchange for the influencer posting about their experience during their stay. 

However, more often than not, influencers expect cash payments for their work. You can expect to pay influencers in Greece using the following payment types:



**Direct Bank Transfer**

A direct bank transfer is a simple and effective way to send money to influencers. 

If the influencer is based in Greece, they will provide you with their Greek bank account details, and you can make the transfer using your bank account. 

You can pay influencers directly from your business bank account, and it‚Äôs a seamless way to ensure they receive their funds.

**PayPal**

PayPal is a widely recognized money transfer service that allows businesses to pay influencers quickly and securely. 

If the influencer has a PayPal account, you can send them money through their email or mobile number. 

PayPal is great for international payments, as the money is transferred in a matter of minutes, and you can use your business credit card to make the payment.

**Venmo**

Venmo is a mobile payment service that allows users to transfer money to others. 

Like PayPal, if the influencer has a Venmo account, you can send them money using your business credit card. 

Venmo is more common with USA influencers, but you can find influencers in Greece that accept payments through Venmo.

**Crypto**

Some influencers might want to be paid in cryptocurrency. 

If you are accustomed to the crypto world, you can pay influencers with Bitcoin or Ethereum, or whichever crypto they prefer to be paid in.

Getting started with crypto payments might require some setup, but if you're already in the world of digital currency, it could be a viable option.

**Brand Sponsorships**

Brand sponsorships are common in influencer collaborations. If you have a product that the influencer can use, you can send them the product and make an agreement to pay them once they have posted. 

This is often a win-win situation as the influencer gets a product they want to promote, and you get instant exposure when they post.



## üé≠ Legal Considerations

As you prepare to partner with influencers in Greece, it's important to follow the legal considerations regarding advertising in the influencer space. 

In Greece, influencers are also required to disclose if they are being paid for their posts. 

In a recent article on influencer advertising guidelines in Greece, it was stated that, "influencers must disclose their relationships with brands whenever the relationship is not clear. The consumer must be able to understand that the influencer is acting on behalf of the brand and that they are being paid for it."

In Greece, influencers should use the phrase "Ad" or "Sponsored" in their posts. 

Also, contracts are recommended when working with influencers in Greece, and legal agreements should outline the scope of work, payment, deadlines, and other obligations.

As you execute your marketing campaign in Greece with local influencers, ensure your brand adheres to the advertising guidelines and other legal considerations to avoid any mishaps.
