## ðŸ’° Factors Influencing Pricing

Pricing can vary not only by the tier but also by the following factors:

- **Engagement Rate and Audience Demographics**: If a V LIVE influencerâ€™s audience engages more with the brand, they can charge more for the collaboration. Likewise, if their audienceâ€™s demographics fit a more niche market, they can also charge more.
  
- **Brand Integration and Deliverables**: The more involved the integration is during the live stream, the more the influencer can charge. For example, if a brand takes a more passive role and only asks for a mention, they will pay less than a brand that wants an active involvement.
  
- **Exclusivity**: If a brand wants to ensure that a V LIVE influencer does not collaborate with their competitors for a set amount of time, they may have to pay extra for the exclusivity.
  
- **V LIVE Features**: Using some of V LIVEâ€™s interactive features incurs added costs which can affect how much a brand pays an influencer.
